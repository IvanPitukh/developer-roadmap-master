# Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. Azure provides a broad spectrum of cloud services, including those for analytics, storage, and networking. As a server-side game developer, you can use these functionalities to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. Furthermore, Azure supports a wide range of tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software. It also offers 4 different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and serverless. Each allows developers to choose the level of control and complexity they wish to maintain over their application and infrastructure.
