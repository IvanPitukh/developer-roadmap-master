# Operation Name

In GraphQL, an operation name is an optional identifier that can be used to uniquely identify a query or a mutation in a document containing multiple operations. It can be used to provide more meaningful names for operations, making it easier to understand the purpose of the operation and to identify it in the event of an error.
