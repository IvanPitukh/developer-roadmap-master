# Client Server

The client-server architecture is a common architecture pattern used in distributed systems, where a client (or multiple clients) send requests to a server, and the server responds to those requests. The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network, such as the Internet or a local network.

The client is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user input, while the server is responsible for processing the requests and returning the appropriate response. The server can also handle tasks such as data storage, security, and business logic.
