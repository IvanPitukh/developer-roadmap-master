# Method Overriding

In TypeScript, method overriding is a mechanism where a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the subclass to inherit the behavior of the parent class, but change its behavior to fit its own needs.

To override a method in TypeScript the signature of the method in the subclass must match exactly with the signature of the method in the parent class.

```typescript
class Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log('Making animal sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log('Bark');
  }
}

let animal: Animal;

animal = new Dog();
animal.makeSound(); // Output: Bark
```

In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the makeSound method defined in the Animal class and provides its own implementation. When the `makeSound` method is called on an instance of the `Dog` class, it will use the implementation in the `Dog` class rather than the implementation in the `Animal` class.
