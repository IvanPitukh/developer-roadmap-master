# Containerization

Containerization in game development refers to the usage of software like Docker, Kubernetes, or similar tools to encapsulate the game's server-side functionality into a single, deployable package. These units, known as containers, include everything the software needs to run, such as libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Containers are platform-agnostic, meaning they can work across different operating environments in the same way. This enables developers to create a consistent experience, reduce the risk of software conflicts, and facilitate easier updates and deployment of their games. Unlike Virtual Machines (VMs), containers do not include whole operating systems, which makes them more lightweight and efficient to run. Developers can run multiple containers on the same machine, each handling different aspects of the server-side functionality. Containers can also communicate with each other, enabling more efficient use of resources.
