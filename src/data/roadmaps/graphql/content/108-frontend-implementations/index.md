# Frontend Implementations

In GraphQL, the frontend refers to the client-side of the application, typically the web or mobile app that the end-user interacts with.

When using GraphQL on the frontend, developers can use a GraphQL client library, such as Apollo Client or Relay, to interact with the GraphQL server. These libraries provide a way to easily send GraphQL queries and mutations to the server and handle the response.
