# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by Ethereum Network team for constructing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

- It's used to create smart contracts that implements business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.
- It acts as a tool for creating machine-level code and compiling it on the Ethereum Vitural Machine (EVM).

Like any other programming languages, Solidity also has variables, functions, classes, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and many more.
