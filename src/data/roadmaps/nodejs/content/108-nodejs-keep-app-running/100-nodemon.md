# Nodemon

In Node.js, you need to restart the process to make changes take effect. This adds an extra step to your workflow. You can eliminate this extra step by using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) or [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) to restart the process automatically.

`nodemon` is a command-line interface (CLI) utility developed by [@rem](https://twitter.com/rem) that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and automatically restarts the process.
