# Key-Value Databases

A key-value database (KV database) is a type of database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. In a KV database, each piece of data is identified by a unique key, and the value is the data associated with that key.

KV databases are designed for fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they are often used in applications that require high performance and low latency. They are particularly well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as log data and user profiles.

Some popular KV databases include Redis, Memcached, and LevelDB. These databases are often used in combination with other types of databases, such as relational databases or document databases, to provide a complete and scalable data storage solution.
