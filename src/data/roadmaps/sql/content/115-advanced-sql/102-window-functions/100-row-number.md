# Row_number

**ROW_NUMBER()** is a SQL window function that assigns a unique number to each row in the result set.

Syntax:

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
[ORDER BY column_name]
)
```

## Features:

- Numbers are assigned based on the `ORDER BY` clause of `ROW_NUMBER()`.
- In case of identical values in the `ORDER BY` clause, the function assigns numbers arbitrarily.
- In other words, the sequence of numbers generated by `ROW_NUMBER()` is not guaranteed to be the same for the same set of data.

## Examples:

**Example 1:** Basic usage of ROW_NUMBER() on a single column
```sql
SELECT 
    name, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY name) row_number
FROM 
    employees;
```
In this example, `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to assign a unique number to each row in the employees table, ordered by the employee names alphabetically.

**Example 2:** Using ROW_NUMBER() to rank rows in each partition
```sql
SELECT 
    department_id, 
    first_name, 
    salary, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY department_id 
        ORDER BY salary DESC) row_number
FROM 
    employees;
```
In this example, `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank employee salaries within each department (i.e., partitioned by `department_id`). In each department, employees with higher salaries are assigned lower row numbers.
