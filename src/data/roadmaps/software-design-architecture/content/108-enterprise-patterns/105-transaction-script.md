# Transaction Script

Transaction Script is a pattern used in enterprise application development that organizes business logic into a single procedural script. It is often used for simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, where all of the logic for a specific transaction is contained in a single script or function. This pattern is simple to implement and easy to understand, but can become unwieldy as the complexity of the application increases. Alternative patterns such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and the Active Record pattern may be more appropriate for more complex applications.
