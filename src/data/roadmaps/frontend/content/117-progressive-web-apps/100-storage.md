# Web Storage API

The Web Storage API provides mechanisms for storing key-value pairs in a web browser. It includes two storage objects: localStorage and sessionStorage, which allow you to save data on the client side and persist it across multiple browser sessions, respectively.

The Web Storage API is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is widely supported across modern web browsers. It is often used as an alternative to cookies, as it allows for larger amounts of data to be stored and is more efficient in terms of performance.
