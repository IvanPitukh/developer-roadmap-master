# MVI

"MVI" stands for Model-View-Intent, and is an architectural pattern used in Android development. This pattern introduces a unidirectional data flow which makes it easier to understand an app's state at any given point in time. In the MVI pattern, the `Intent` represents an intention or desire to perform an action, often triggered by user inputs. The `View` is responsible for rendering the UI and emitting intents. The `Model`, on the other hand, represents the state of the app and reacts to intents by changing its state. It's the Model's responsibility to respond to each Intent with a resulting new state. Once a new state is created, it is published back to the `View`. This clear separation and single direction of data and event flow can help in managing side-effects and handling asynchronous actions.
