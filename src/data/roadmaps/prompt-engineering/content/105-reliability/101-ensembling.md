# Prompt Ensembling

Ensembling is a technique used to improve the reliability and accuracy of predictions by combining multiple different models, essentially leveraging the 'wisdom of the crowd'. The idea is that combining the outputs of several models can cancel out biases, reduce variance, and lead to a more accurate and robust prediction.

There are several ensembling techniques that can be used, including:

- **Majority voting**: Each model votes for a specific output, and the one with the most votes is the final prediction.
- **Weighted voting**: Similar to majority voting, but each model has a predefined weight based on its performance, accuracy, or other criteria. The final prediction is based on the weighted sum of all model predictions.
- **Bagging**: Each model is trained on a slightly different dataset, typically generated by sampling with replacement (bootstrap) from the original dataset. The predictions are then combined, usually through majority voting or averaging.
- **Boosting**: A sequential ensemble method where each new model aims to correct the mistakes made by the previous models. The final prediction is a weighted combination of the outputs from all models.
- **Stacking**: Multiple base models predict the output, and these predictions are used as inputs for a second-layer model, which provides the final prediction.

Incorporating ensembling in your prompt engineering process can help produce more reliable results, but be mindful of factors such as increased computational complexity and potential overfitting. To achieve the best results, make sure to use diverse models in your ensemble and pay attention to tuning their parameters, balancing their weights, and selecting suitable ensembling techniques based on your specific problem and dataset.
