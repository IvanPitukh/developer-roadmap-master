# Toast

`Toast` in Android is a simple message that appears on the screen for a short period of time then disappears automatically. It is generally used to provide feedback to the user about an operation in a small popup without requiring any user interaction. This feedback could be an error message or simply information that a process completed successfully. You can configure the toast to appear anywhere on the screen and specify how long it stays up. In order to use a toast, you have to import the `android.widget.Toast` package and instantiate a Toast object. Here's an example of creating a simple toast: `Toast.makeText(context, text, duration).show()`, where context is your application context, text is the message to display, and duration is either `Toast.LENGTH_SHORT` or `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`.
