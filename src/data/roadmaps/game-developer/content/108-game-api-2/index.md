"Game API 2" refers to the next generation or updated version of a Game API (Application Programming Interface). With the functionalities provided by the game API, as a developer, you can utilize pre-written sets of codes to build games, instead of creating everything from scratch. The main focus of "Game API 2" often revolves around delivering improved functionalities, ease of use, and better performance, aiding in creating more complex and advanced games. Some examples may include access to new graphical features, optimized resource management, or better hardware utilization. Specific capabilities usually depend on the respective Game API you are using. However, it's important to note that "Game API 2" is a generalized term, and you may need to refer to specific APIs documentation (such as DirectX 12 for Microsoft, Vulkan for Khronos Group, etc.) for an in-depth understanding.
