# Sentry

Sentry is an open-source error tracking platform that helps developers identify and fix errors in their applications. It provides detailed error reports, including stack traces, context data, and user feedback, making it easy to understand and reproduce errors. Sentry can be integrated with a variety of platforms, including .NET and ASP.NET.

In an ASP.NET application, Sentry can be used to capture and track errors that occur in the application. Sentry provides an SDK, called Sentry.NET, which can be integrated with an ASP.NET application to automatically capture and track errors. The SDK can be configured to capture and track different types of errors, including unhandled exceptions, handled exceptions, and custom events.
