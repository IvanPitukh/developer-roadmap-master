# Tuple

A tuple type is another sort of Array type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.

```typescript
type StringNumberPair = [string, number];

const pair: StringNumberPair = ['hello', 42];

const first = pair[0];
const second = pair[1];

// Error: Index out of bounds
const third = pair[2];
```
