# Builder Pattern

The **Builder Pattern** in Android is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation. The pattern involves a `Builder` class which is used to construct the `Product` class. The Builder class typically has a method for each part that may be used to construct a Product. It also has a method for returning the final product. The Builder pattern is useful in situations where you might have multiple ways to create an object or when an object requires a large number of parameters for its constructor.
