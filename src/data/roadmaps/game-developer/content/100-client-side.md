# Client Side

In game development, the term "Client Side" refers to all the operations and activities that occur on the player's machine, which could be a console, computer, or even a phone. The client side is responsible for rendering graphics, handling input from the user and sometimes processing game logic. This is in contrast to the server-side operations, which involve handling multiplayer connections and synchronizing game states among multiple clients. On the client side, developers need to ensure performance optimization, smooth UI/UX, quick load times, and security to provide an engaging, lag-free gaming experience. Security is also crucial to prevent cheating in multiplayer games, which can be tackled through measures like Data obfuscation and encryption.
