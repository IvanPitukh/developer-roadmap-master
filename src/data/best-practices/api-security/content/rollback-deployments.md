# Rollback Solution

> Design a rollback solution for deployments.

Sometimes deploying a new version of the API can introduce unexpected bugs or issues that were not caught during testing. In such cases, rolling back to the previous version of the API can help to mitigate the impact of the issue and restore the service to a functional state. A well-designed rollback solution can help reduce downtime and minimize the impact on users.
