# Make Reward Scarce

One of the effective techniques to create urgency in UX design is to make rewards scarce. Making a reward scarce means limiting its availability in terms of quantity or time. This scarcity increases its perceived value leading to urgency among users to act fast in order to avail the reward. Here, we'll discuss some strategies to make rewards scarce in your design:

## Limited Quantity

Introduce rewards with limited quantities, making users feel that they need to act fast before the rewards are gone. This exerts psychological pressure as users do not want to miss out on the opportunity.

_Example_: You can offer a limited quantity promotion wherein the first 50 customers to make a purchase receive a bonus gift or a special discount.

## Limited Time Offers

Creating time-based limitations on rewards is another effective way to increase urgency. The inherent nature of time works its magic by encouraging users to be quick to avoid missing out on the reward.

_Example_: Flash sales, 24-hour promotions and countdown timers are examples of limited-time offers that create urgency to buy now or miss out on the deal.

## Exclusive Access

Offering exclusive access to specific features, content or experiences for a limited number of users not only increases perceived value but also adds a sense of exclusivity.

_Example_: Granting access to a members-only online event, beta release of an application, or special product launches can create urgency to sign-up or purchase for the privilege of having that exclusive access.

## Seasonal Rewards

Align the rewards with seasons, events, or holidays, creating a natural sense of scarcity due to the time-bound nature of these events.

_Example_: Offering discounts, special promotions, or limited edition items connected to holidays or events like Christmas, Valentine's Day, Black Friday, etc., can create a sense of urgency as users are aware that these opportunities only come around once a year.

Remember to apply these strategies ethically and transparently when designing experiences in your application. Creating genuine scarcity and urgency will ensure that your users value your offers and continue to engage with your product.
