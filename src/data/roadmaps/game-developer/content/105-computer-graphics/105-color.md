# Color

In the realm of computer graphics, color plays an integral role. It can be defined in various color models such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue), CYMK (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Black), and others. RGB is a color model that combines the primary colors (red, green, blue) in different amounts to produce a spectrum of colors. This model is often used in digital displays. In contrast, CMYK is a color model used in color printing. It uses cyan, magyenta, yellow, and black as the primary colors. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are other useful models that represent colors based on human perceptions. Another important element of color in computer graphics is the color depth, also known as bit depth, which determines the number of colors that can be displayed at once.
