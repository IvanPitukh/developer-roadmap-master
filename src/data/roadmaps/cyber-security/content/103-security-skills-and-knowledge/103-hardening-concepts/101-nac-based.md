# NAC-based

Network Access Control (NAC) based hardening is a crucial component in enhancing the security of your network infrastructure. NAC provides organizations with the ability to control and manage access to the network resources, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can connect to the network. It plays a vital role in reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.

## Key Features of NAC-Based Hardening

- **Authentication and Authorization:** NAC-based hardening ensures that users and devices connecting to the network are properly authenticated and have been granted appropriate access permissions. This includes the use of strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enforcing access control policies.

- **Endpoint Health Checks:** NAC solutions continuously monitor the health and compliance of endpoints, such as whether anti-virus software and security patches are up to date. If a device is found to be non-compliant, it can be automatically quarantined or disconnected from the network, thus preventing the spread of threats.

- **Real-Time Visibility and Control:** NAC provides real-time visibility into the devices connected to your network, allowing you to identify and control risks proactively. This includes monitoring for unauthorized devices, unusual behavior, or known security gaps.

- **Device Profiling:** NAC-based hardening can automatically identify and classify devices connected to the network, making it easier to enforce access control policies based on device type and ownership.

- **Policy Enforcement:** NAC solutions enforce granular access policies for users and devices, reducing the attack surface and limiting the potential damage of a security breach. Policies can be based on factors such as user role, device type, and location.

## NAC Best Practices

To get the most out of a NAC-based hardening approach, here are some best practices to consider:

- **Develop a Comprehensive Access Control Policy:** Clearly define the roles, responsibilities, and access permissions within your organization, ensuring that users have the least privilege required to perform their job functions.
- **Regularly Review and Update Policies:** As your organization evolves, so should your NAC policies. Regularly review and update policies to maintain alignment with organizational changes.
- **Educate Users:** Educate end-users about the importance of security and their role in maintaining a secure network. Offer training on topics such as password management, avoiding phishing attacks, and identifying social engineering attempts.
- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure that your NAC solution covers all entry points to your network, including remote access, wireless networks, and guest access.
- **Monitor and Respond to NAC Alerts:** NAC solutions generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected, such as an unauthorized device trying to connect to the network. Make sure you have a process in place to respond to these alerts in a timely manner.

By implementing NAC-based hardening in your cybersecurity strategy, you protect your organization from threats and maintain secure access to critical resources.
