# Payments

The Payment Request API is a web API that allows web developers to build checkout flows within their web applications. It provides a standardized, browser-based interface for collecting payment and shipping information from the user, and it supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.

To use the Payment Request API, a web page must first create a `PaymentRequest` object and specify the payment and shipping options that are available to the user. The page can then invoke the Payment Request UI by calling the `show()` method on the `PaymentRequest` object. The user can then select their preferred payment and shipping options and confirm the payment, at which point the Payment Request API will return a payment response object that can be used to complete the transaction.

The Payment Request API is supported by most modern web browsers and is designed to be simple and efficient for both the developer and the user.
