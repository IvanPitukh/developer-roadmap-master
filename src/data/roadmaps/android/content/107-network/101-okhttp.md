# OkHttp

`OkHttp` is an HTTP client that's extremely efficient, enabling several advanced features in Android app or other platforms that use Java. Developed by Square, it's built for high efficiency and capacity, simplifying many networking tasks, including connection pooling, response caching, and request retries. OkHttp allows seamless recovery from network issues, minimizing the loss of data. The library ensures fewer errors and higher quality of service by using the modern TLS encryption, extensible request and response models, and a fluent API for ease of use and integration.
