# Memory lifecycle

Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same:

- Allocate the memory you need
- Use the allocated memory (read, write)
- Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore

The second part is explicit in all languages. The first and last parts are explicit in low-level languages but are mostly implicit in high-level languages like JavaScript.
