# QA Basics

The phrase "fit for use or purpose" sums up quality, which is incredibly difficult to define. It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product's usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.

Assurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.

Quality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.
