# Collections

In Dart, collections are used to store and manipulate groups of objects. There are several types of collections available, including:

1. List (ordered and indexable)
2. Set (unordered and unique elements)
3. Map (key-value pairs)
4. Queue (ordered and first-in-first-out)
5. Stack (ordered and last-in-first-out)

These collections are built-in data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently. They can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as storing user data, managing state, and organizing algorithms.
