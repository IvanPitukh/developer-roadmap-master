# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team. It is designed for building, training, and deploying deep learning models. TensorFlow provides a set of tools for ML, deep learning, and numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow can process computations on GPUs and TPUs, which speed up training time and ensures efficient model deployment.

## Installation

You can install TensorFlow using the Python package manager pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Basic usage

Here's a simple example of how to create and train a neural network with TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load dataset
mnist = keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess data
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)

# Evaluate model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```

This code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the data, creates a simple neural network, compiles it, trains it, and evaluates its performance on the test set.

For more advanced usage, TensorFlow offers several APIs like `tf.data`, `tf.keras`, and `tf.estimator` that enable flexible and efficient data input pipelines, composing and training complex neural network architectures, and managing large-scale distributed training.
