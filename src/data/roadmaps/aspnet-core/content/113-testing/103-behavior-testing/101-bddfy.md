# BDDfy

BDDfy is an open-source, fluent, and extensible BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework for .NET, which allows developers to create automated acceptance tests in a readable and expressive format. BDDfy is commonly used in the context of ASP.NET and other .NET technologies, to write acceptance tests for web applications. With BDDfy, developers can write test scenarios using a fluent API, which allows them to describe the behavior of their application in a natural language format. The framework also provides a set of extension methods, which can be used to add additional functionality, such as validating the output of a test, logging test results, or integrating with other testing tools. BDDfy also comes with a built-in test runner, which makes it easy to execute tests and view the results. The framework supports a variety of test runners, such as NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest, and can be integrated with other BDD frameworks, such as SpecFlow and Cucumber.
