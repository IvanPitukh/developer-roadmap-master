# Authentication vs Authorization

To ensure cybersecurity, it's essential to understand the differences between two key concepts: **Authentication** and **Authorization**. Though the terms might sound similar, they have distinct functions in ensuring the security of your systems and applications.

## Authentication

**Authentication** is the process of validating the identity of a user, device, or system. It confirms that the entity attempting to access the resource is who or what they claim to be. The most common form of authentication is the use of usernames and passwords. Other methods include:

- [Two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/)
- [Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428991/)
- [Security tokens or certificates](https://www.comodo.com/e-commerce/ssl-certificates/certificate.php)

In simple terms, authentication answers the question, _"Who are you?"_

## Authorization

**Authorization** comes into play after the authentication process is complete. It involves granting or denying access to a resource, based on the authenticated user's privileges. Authorization determines what actions the authenticated user or entity is allowed to perform within a system or application.

For example, a basic user may be authorized to view and edit their personal data, while an administrator would have the authority to access and manage all user accounts within the same application.

Common methods of implementing authorization include:

- [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
- [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list)
- [Attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)

In a nutshell, authorization answers the question, _"What are you allowed to do?"_

## Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are critical components of a secure system. By understanding their distinct roles in the security process, you can better manage access to resources and protect sensitive data. Remember, authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization determines and enforces the actions and resources the user is permitted to access within a system or application.
