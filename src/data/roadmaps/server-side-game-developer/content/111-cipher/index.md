# Cipher

**Cipher** is a vital component in the field of cryptography and is used to encrypt and decrypt information. It is essentially a series of well-defined steps or algorithms followed to convert sensitive information or data into a form that appears to be random and meaningless. This transformed information can only be turned back into its original form with a specific decryption key. Based on their methodology, ciphers are broadly classified into two categories: block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers work on a chunk of data at once, whereas stream ciphers work on a individual bits or bytes. Examples of ciphers include: Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher among others. Usage of ciphers enhances the security in server-side game development by ensuring that player data remains confidential and is not subjected to unauthorized access or manipulation.
