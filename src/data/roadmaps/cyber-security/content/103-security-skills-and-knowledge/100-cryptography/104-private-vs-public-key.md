# Pvt Key vs Pub Key

Cryptography plays a vital role in securing cyber systems from unauthorized access and protecting sensitive information. One of the most popular methods used for ensuring data privacy and authentication is the concept of **Public-Key Cryptography**. This type of cryptography relies on two distinct keys: **Private Key** and **Public Key**. This section provides a brief summary of Private Keys and Public Keys, and highlights the differences between the two.

## Private Key

A Private Key, also known as a Secret Key, is a confidential cryptographic key that is uniquely associated with an individual or an organization. It should be kept secret and not revealed to anyone, except the authorized person who owns it. The Private Key is used for decrypting data that was encrypted using the corresponding Public Key, or for signing digital documents, proving the identity of the signer.

Key characteristics of Private Keys:

- Confidential and not shared with others
- Used for decryption or digital signing
- Loss or theft of Private Key can lead to data breaches and compromise of sensitive information

## Public Key

A Public Key is an openly available cryptographic key that is paired with a Private Key. Anyone can use the Public Key to encrypt data or to verify signatures, but only the person/organization with the corresponding Private Key can decrypt the encrypted data or create signatures. The Public Key can be distributed freely without compromising the security of the underlying cryptographic system.

Key characteristics of Public Keys:

- Publicly available and can be shared with anyone
- Used for encryption or verifying digital signatures
- Loss or theft of Public Key does not compromise sensitive information or communication security

## Key Differences

The main differences between Private and Public keys are as follows:

- Ownership: The Private Key is confidential and owned by a specific individual/organization, while the Public Key is owned by the same individual/organization but can be publicly distributed.
- Accessibility: The Private Key is never shared or revealed to anyone, whereas the Public Key can be shared freely.
- Purpose: The Private Key is used for decrypting data and creating digital signatures, while the Public Key is used for encrypting data and verifying digital signatures.
- Security: Loss or theft of the Private Key can lead to serious security breaches while losing a Public Key does not compromise the security of the system.

Understanding the roles and differences between Private and Public Keys is essential for ensuring the effective application of Public-Key Cryptography in securing cyber systems and protecting sensitive information.
