# Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring in k8s involves keeping an eye on the health and performance of the cluster and its components. This includes monitoring the usage and availability of resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of the k8s services and nodes. Some popular monitoring solutions for k8s include Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog.

Logging in k8s involves collecting and analyzing the logs generated by the various components in the cluster, such as the applications, pods, and nodes. These logs can provide insights into the behavior and performance of the cluster, and can also help with troubleshooting issues. Some popular logging solutions for k8s include Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
