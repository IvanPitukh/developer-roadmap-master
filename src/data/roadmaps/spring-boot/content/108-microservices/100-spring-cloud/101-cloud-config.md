# Cloud Config

Spring Cloud Config is a library for managing configuration properties for distributed applications. It allows developers to externalize configuration properties for an application, so that they can be easily changed without modifying the application's code. It also provides a centralized server for storing and managing configuration properties for multiple applications, making it easy to update and rollback configurations across different environments.

By using Spring Cloud Config, developers can have a centralized and consistent approach for managing the configuration properties of their microservices or distributed applications, making it easy to modify the properties without having to change the code, also it helps in maintaining different environment configuration easily.
