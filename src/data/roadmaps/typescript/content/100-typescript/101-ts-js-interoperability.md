# TS/JS Interoperability

TypeScript and JavaScript have full interoperability, meaning you can use TypeScript code in JavaScript projects and vice versa. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

You can use JavaScript libraries in TypeScript projects by either including the JavaScript files directly or using type definitions for the library. Type definitions provide type information for JavaScript libraries, making it easier to use them in TypeScript.

On the other hand, you can use TypeScript code in JavaScript projects by simply compiling the TypeScript code into JavaScript. The generated JavaScript code can be used in any JavaScript environment, and it will work the same way as regular JavaScript code.
