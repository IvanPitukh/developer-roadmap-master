# gRPC

`gRPC` (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework designed by Google. The gRPC framework supports a wide range of languages, and it is based on the proto3 protocol buffer (protobuf) language. It uses Protocol Buffers as the interface definition language for defining the method parameters service and return types. gRPC is designed to work over a variety of different pluggable transports and also supports load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It's functionality is particularly suited for point-to-point services within a microservice architecture.
