# Validate User Input

> Validate user input to avoid common vulnerabilities

User input is a common source of vulnerabilities in web applications. This is because user input is often not properly validated, sanitized, or escaped before being used in a web application. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the input and execute malicious code or cause the application to behave unexpectedly.
