# Peer to Peer

Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture is a distributed computing architecture in which each node (peer) in the network acts as both a client and a server. In P2P architecture, there is no central authority or server that manages the network, and each node communicates directly with other nodes to exchange information, share resources, and perform computations.

The main advantage of using P2P architecture is that it allows for a more decentralized and fault-tolerant system. As there is no central authority, there is no single point of failure, and the network can continue to function even if some nodes fail. Additionally, P2P architecture can also improve scalability as the number of nodes in the network increases.
