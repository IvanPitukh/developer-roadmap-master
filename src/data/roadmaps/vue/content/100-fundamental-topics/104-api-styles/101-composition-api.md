# Composition API

With the release of Vue 3, developers now have access to the Composition API, a new way to write Vue components. This API allows features to be grouped together logically, rather than having to organize your single-file components by function. Using the Composition API can lead to more readable code, and gives the developer more flexibility when developing their applications.
