# Advanced Types

Advanced types in TypeScript are a set of advanced type constructs that allow for more complex and expressive type systems. Some of the most commonly used advanced types in TypeScript include:

- Intersection Types
- Union Types
- Type Aliases
- Conditional Types
- Index Types
- Mapped Types
- Type Guards

These advanced types allow for more complex and expressive type systems, and enable you to write code that is safer, more maintainable, and easier to understand. By leveraging these advanced types, you can write code that is more robust, less prone to errors, and easier to maintain.
