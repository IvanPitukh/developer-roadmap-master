# Concrete Classes

A concrete class is a class in object-oriented programming (OOP) that can be instantiated, meaning objects can be created from it. A concrete class is a class that provides an implementation for all of the abstract methods declared in its parent class, if it inherits from an abstract class. A concrete class can also be a class that does not inherit from an abstract class, in that case it can have implementation for all of its methods.

Concrete classes are used to provide specific implementation details for a group of related classes that inherit from a common abstract class. They are also used to define unique behavior for a specific class. A concrete class can have its own methods and variables, and can also override the methods of its parent class.
