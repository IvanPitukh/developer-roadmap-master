# Synchrony

In a reactive paradigm, "synchrony" is a key concept related to data management and interactions among multiple components in a server-side game development context. It refers to the idea that operations or processes are executed 'in sync', meaning that the next operation starts strictly after the previous operation has already finished. In a synchronous communication, for instance, the sender can't start a new communication until the receiver confirmed receiving the last parcel. It's different from "asynchrony" where various operations can run concurrently, not waiting for previous operations to finish before moving on. Overall, understanding the concepts of synchrony and asynchrony are crucial for making efficient use of resources in server-side game development, and picking the right approach depends on the specific use case and requirements.
