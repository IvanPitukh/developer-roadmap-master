# tsc

`tsc` is the command line tool for the TypeScript compiler. It compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript code, making it compatible with the browser or any JavaScript runtime environment.

You can use the `tsc` command to compile your TypeScript code by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
tsc
```

This command will compile all TypeScript files in your project that are specified in your `tsconfig.json` file. If you want to compile a specific TypeScript file, you can specify the file name after the `tsc` command, like this:

```bash
tsc index.ts
```

The `tsc` command has several options and flags that you can use to customize the compilation process. For example, you can use the `--target` option to specify the version of JavaScript to compile to, or the `--outDir` option to specify the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files.

You can run `tsc --help` to see a list of all the available options and flags.
