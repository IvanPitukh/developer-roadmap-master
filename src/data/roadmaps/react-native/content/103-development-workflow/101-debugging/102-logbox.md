# LogBox

LogBox is a new feature added to React Native to improve how logs are displayed and managed in your development environment. It provides better visualization and organization of logs, warnings, and errors, making it easier for developers to address issues in their code.

- **Better Error Formatting**: Errors are displayed in a more understandable format with clear syntax highlighting and relevant information regarding the error and the specific code that caused it.

- **Improved Warnings**: Warnings now come with filtering and sorting options, allowing you to control which warnings you want to prioritize or ignore during development.

- **Component Stacks**: Instead of displaying the raw call stack, LogBox provides a component stack that shows component hierarchy, allowing you to pinpoint the exact component causing the issue.

- **Customizable**: You can disable LogBox, customize its behavior, or even extend it with your own code to tailor your debugging experience.
