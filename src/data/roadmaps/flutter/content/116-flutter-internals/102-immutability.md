# Immutability

Immutability in Flutter refers to objects that cannot be changed once they are created. In Flutter, immutability is used to ensure that objects in the widget tree are not modified unexpectedly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the app.

In Flutter, objects that represent the state of the app, such as widgets and their properties, are considered immutable. When the state of the app changes, a new object is created to represent the new state, and the widget tree is rebuilt with the updated objects.
