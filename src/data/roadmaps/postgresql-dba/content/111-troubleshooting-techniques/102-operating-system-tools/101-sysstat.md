# Sysstat

[Sysstat](https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat) is a collection of performance monitoring tools for Linux. It collects various system statistics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, network traffic, and more. System administrators can use these tools to monitor the performance of their servers and identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

## Key Features

* Collects various types of system data for performance analysis
* Provides tools to view historical data, allowing for trend analysis and capacity planning
* Customizable data collection intervals and output format
* Support for scripting and integration with other tools

## Main Components

Sysstat includes several command-line utilities that collect and display system performance data. Some of the most important tools are:

* **sar**: System Activity Reporter, the central utility that collects, stores, and displays system statistics. It can be used in real-time or to analyze historical data.
* **iostat**: Provides detailed statistics about disk I/O (input/output) for individual devices, partitions, or NFS mounts.
* **mpstat**: Reports processor-related statistics, useful to monitor CPU usage by different processors or cores in a system.
* **pidstat**: Reports statistics for Linux tasks (processes), including CPU, memory, and I/O usage.
* **vmstat**: Displays information about system memory, processes, interrupts, and CPU activity.

## Using Sysstat with PostgreSQL

Monitoring the performance of a PostgreSQL server is essential for optimizing its performance and ensuring its reliability. Sysstat tools can help you identify server resource usage, spot potential issues, and fine-tune your configuration.

For example, you can use _iostat_ to monitor the disk activity of your PostgreSQL data directory, which can help you identify slow storage devices or contention from other workloads.

Using _mpstat_ and _pidstat_ can help you identify CPU-bound queries or contention between your PostgreSQL server and other processes running on the same system.

And _vmstat_ can help you spot issues with memory usage, such as excessive swapping or memory pressure on the host system.
