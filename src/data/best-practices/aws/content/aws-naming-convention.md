# Naming Convention

> Decide on a naming convention early, and stick to it.

There's a lot of resources on AWS where you can change the name later, but there's equally a lot where you cannot (security group names, etc). Having a consistent naming convention will help to self-document your infrastructure. Don't forget to make use of tags too.
