# Never

The `never` type represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, `never` is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns. Variables also acquire the type never when narrowed by any type guards that can never be `true`.

The never type is a subtype of, and assignable to, every type; however, no type is a subtype of, or assignable to, `never` (except `never` itself). Even any isnâ€™t assignable to `never`.

Examples of functions returning never:

```typescript
// Function returning never must not have a reachable end point
function error(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

// Inferred return type is never
function fail() {
  return error('Something failed');
}

// Function returning never must not have a reachable end point
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```
