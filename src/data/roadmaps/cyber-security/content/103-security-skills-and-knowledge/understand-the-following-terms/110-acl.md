# ACL

An Access Control List (ACL) is a security feature used in computer systems, networks, and applications to define rules and restrictions for granting or denying access to specific resources. It helps organizations manage user access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information and resources.

ACLs consist of entries that specify the permissions each user or group of users have for a particular resource. These permissions can include read, write, execute, and delete access.

## Key Components of an ACL

- **Resource:** The object or system that you want to protect, such as files, folders, applications, or network devices.

- **User or Group:** The user account or group of users that need access to the protected resource.

- **Permission:** A set of actions (e.g., read, write, execute) the user or group is allowed to perform on the resource.

## Why ACLs are Important for Cyber Security:

- **Access control:** ACLs are a fundamental tool for implementing access controls, making it an essential component of an organization's overall security strategy.

- **Auditing and compliance:** ACLs help organizations ensure compliance with various regulations and industry standards by providing detailed information regarding user access to critical and sensitive resources.

- **Reduced risk of unauthorized access:** Implementing ACLs minimizes the risk of unauthorized users accessing an organization's confidential information, as well as prevents unauthorized changes that can lead to data breaches or loss.

In summary, Access Control Lists play a vital role in maintaining an organization's cyber security posture by controlling access to resources and ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions on those resources.
