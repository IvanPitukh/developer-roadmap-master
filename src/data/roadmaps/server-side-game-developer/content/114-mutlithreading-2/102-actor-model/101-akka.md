# Akka (Java)

Akka is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the JVM. It implements the Actor Model for handling concurrency, allowing developers to create systems that can handle high volumes of transactions in a distributed environment. Yet, Akka is not only about Actors, it features other tools for building reactive applications, including Event Sourcing, CQRS, Cluster Sharding, and Distributed Data. Written in Scala and providing APIs in both Scala and Java, Akka powers numerous business-critical systems in sectors such as finance, tech, streaming, and others.
