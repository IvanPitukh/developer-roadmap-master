# GraphQL Over SSE

GraphQL over SSE (Server-Sent Events) is a way to use the Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol to send real-time updates from the server to the client over a single HTTP connection.

SSE is a simple and efficient protocol for sending real-time updates from the server to the client over a single HTTP connection. It's supported by most modern web browsers and it's easy to implement on the server side.

To implement GraphQL over SSE, you can use a library such as graphql-sse which provides a way to send GraphQL updates over SSE. This library allows you to handle SSE connections and events, and to send and receive GraphQL updates over the SSE connection.
