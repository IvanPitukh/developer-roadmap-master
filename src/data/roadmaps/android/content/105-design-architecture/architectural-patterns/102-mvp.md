# MVP

MVP stands for Model-View-Presenter. It is an architectural pattern often used in Android development. In MVP, the architect separates the application's responsibilities into three main layers. The 'Model' refers to the data and business logic of the application. The 'View', typically implemented by an Activity or Fragment in Android, is responsible for displaying the data to the user and collecting user inputs. Lastly, the 'Presenter' works as a bridge between the Model and the View. It listens to user interactions from the View and updates the Model accordingly, and also updates the View based on changes in the Model. This separation of responsibilities allows for better code organization, easier testing, and greater flexibility.
