# WAL-G - An Advanced Backup Recovery Tool for PostgreSQL

**WAL-G** is an open-source backup management tool for PostgreSQL databases, designed to efficiently store and manage your backups while offering continuous archiving and point-in-time recovery. It builds upon the concept of Write Ahead Logs (WAL), preserving all modifications to the database and ensuring durability and consistency.

## Features of WAL-G

- **Tree-based Incremental Backups**: WAL-G leverages tree-based incremental backups, which allows for efficient storage of the backup information, reducing the time and space required to create and maintain your backups.

- **Delta Backups**: It compresses the data and minimizes space requirements by creating full, incremental and delta backups. Delta backups contain only the differences from previous delta or full backups.

- **Encryption and Compression**: WAL-G provides options for encryption and compression of the WAL files, which helps to save storage space and improve data security.

- **PITR (Point-in-time Recovery)**: WAL-G enables you to recover the database to a specific point in time, down to an individual transaction level. This feature can be helpful in case of data corruption or human error.

- **Compatible with Multiple PostgreSQL Versions**: It supports a wide range of PostgreSQL versions (9.6 and newer) and various storage types, such as AWS S3, GCS, and other platforms.

## How to Use WAL-G

To use WAL-G, you must first install the WAL-G library, configure the environment variables, and set up the required access credentials for your storage provider.

- **Installation**: You can download the library from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases) or use package managers like apt or yum. Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g#installation) for step-by-step instructions.

- **Configuration**: Set the necessary environment variables for WAL-G, including credentials, storage provider, and encryption settings. Here's an example configuration for AWS S3:
    ```
    export WALG_S3_PREFIX=s3://mybucket/backups
    export AWS_REGION=us-west-1
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_access_key
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_secret_key
    export WALG_COMPRESSION_METHOD=brotli
    export WALG_ENCRYPTION_KEY=some_encryption_key
    ```
- **Using WAL-G Commands**: WAL-G offers several commands to manage and restore your backups, such as `backup-push`, `backup-fetch`, `wal-push`, `wal-fetch`, and more. To know more about these commands, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g#commands).

By using WAL-G, you can have a robust and efficient backup management system for your PostgreSQL databases, ensuring data durability, consistency, and quick recovery when needed.
