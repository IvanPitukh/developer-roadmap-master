# Real-Time Ray Tracing

**Real-time Ray Tracing** is a notable advancement in rendering technology. It aims to mimic the way light works in the real world by simulating how each ray of light interacts with different surfaces. In real-time ray tracing, rays of light are generated from the viewer's perspective and sent into the scene. They can reflect off surfaces, refract through materials, or scatter in different directions. These rays can also be absorbed, producing shadows and shaping the visibility of objects. What makes real-time ray tracing special is its ability to calculate all these interactions in real-time, which allows graphics to be much more dynamic and interactive. The complexity of real-time ray tracing involves extensive computational power and it has been a groundbreaking feature in newer hardware and software releases.
