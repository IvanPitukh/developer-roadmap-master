# CSR vs SSR

CSR stands for Client Side Rendering and SSR stands for Server Side Rendering. CSR pages are computed in your machine and then shown by your browser while in the case of SSR, the server sends ready to show Html content directly. Primarily React, Vue, and Angular apps are examples of CSR (technically it is possible for them to be executed in SSR mode too) and almost all older tech stacks are SSR like PHP, ruby on rails, java, dot net, etc. From the user's standpoint, CSR apps take higher time to render but compensate by avoiding page reloads later (SPA) while SSR apps often have faster initial load time but do a full page reload often.
