# State Management

State management in Flutter refers to the process of managing and updating the data or state of a Flutter application. In Flutter, the state of the widgets can change dynamically, for example, when a user interacts with the application. The state management techniques in Flutter include:

- ScopedModel: a third-party state management solution that uses a centralized model to manage the state.
- Provider: a lightweight solution that allows widgets to access the state with minimal boilerplate code.
- BLoC (Business Logic Component): a state management technique that uses streams and reactive programming to manage the state.
- Redux: a state management solution inspired by the Redux library in React.
- InheritedWidget: a built-in widget that allows the state to be passed down the widget tree.

The choice of state management technique depends on the complexity and size of the project. For smaller projects, Provider or InheritedWidget may be sufficient, while larger projects may require a more robust solution like ScopedModel or Redux.
