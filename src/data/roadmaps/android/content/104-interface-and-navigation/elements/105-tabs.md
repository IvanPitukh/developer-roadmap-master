# Tabs

Tabs are commonly used in Android for switching between different views within the same activity. Some instances may make use of a `TabLayout` located within a `ViewPager` to create swipeable tabs. Each tab is usually associated with a fragment. To create tabs in Android, you need to use the `TabLayout` component that is available in the Material Design library. A typical `TabLayout` contains multiple `TabItem`, each representing a tab in the interface. The `TabLayout` works with a `ViewPager` to provide a consistent swipeable interface. Users can approach tabs differently depending on whether they are coded for manual or automatic filling. Manual tab creation and addition require explicit defining of each tab and adding them to the `TabLayout`, while in automatic filling tabs are generated from the `PagerAdaptor`'s page title.
