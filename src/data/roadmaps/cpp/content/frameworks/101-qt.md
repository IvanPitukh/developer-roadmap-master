# Qt Framework

Qt is an open-source, cross-platform framework for creating high-performance applications with interactive user interfaces. It is mainly used for developing GUI applications but can also be used for creating non-GUI applications like console tools and servers.

Qt provides a wide range of C++ libraries and seamless integration with popular IDEs, making it easier for developers to create feature-rich applications. It offers a comprehensive development environment, including tools for designing, coding, debugging, and profiling applications.

## Key Features

- **Cross-platform**: Qt can create applications that run on different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) without any platform-specific code.
- **Modular Libraries**: Qt consists of several modular libraries, including QtCore (core non-GUI functionality), QtGui (GUI-related classes), QtWidgets (GUI widgets), and QtNetwork (networking support).
- **Signals and Slots**: Qt provides a unique mechanism to handle events called "signals and slots", which allows safe and flexible inter-object communication.
- **OpenGL Integration**: Qt supports rendering 2D and 3D graphics using OpenGL, making it suitable for game development and other graphical applications.

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a "Hello, World!" application using Qt:

```cpp
#include <QApplication>
#include <QLabel>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    QLabel label("Hello, World!");
    label.show();

    return app.exec();
}
```

In this example, we include the necessary header files, create QApplication and QLabel objects, display the label with a "Hello, World!" message, and execute the application.

To compile and run this example, you need to install the Qt library and configure your development environment to use it.
