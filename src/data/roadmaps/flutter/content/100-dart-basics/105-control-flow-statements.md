# Control Flow Statements

In Dart, control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program. The following are the main types of control flow statements in Dart:

- if-else: used to conditionally execute code based on a boolean expression.
- for loop: used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
- while loop: used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
- do-while loop: similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated.
- switch-case: used to select one of several code blocks to execute based on a value.
- break: used to exit a loop early.
- continue: used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next one.

These control flow statements can be used to create complex logic and control the flow of execution in Dart programs.
