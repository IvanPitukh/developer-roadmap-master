# GLSL

GLSL (Graphics Library Shader Language) is a high-level shading language inspired by C, based on the syntax of the OpenGL Shading Language. It is used in graphics programming for defining how the graphical content should look. GLSL allows developers to harness the power of modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), enabling direct, unconstrained control over graphics rendering. A key aspect of the language is its ability to create shaders, which are small programs that run on the GPU. Shaders are used for various graphical effects like vertex manipulation, pixel color calculations, or post-processing effects.
