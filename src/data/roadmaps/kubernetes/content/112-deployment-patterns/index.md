# Deployment Patterns

Deployments is a Kubernetes resource used to declaratively manage the rollout and scaling of application containers across a cluster. Deployments allow teams to define the desired state of a deployment and automatically manage the underlying pods and replica sets to achieve that state. Kubernetes provides various deployment strategies such as RollingUpdate or Canary to control how new versions of an application are rolled out and scaled.
