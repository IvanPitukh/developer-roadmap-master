# Primary Principles

There are several primary principles that are considered fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP). These principles include:

- Encapsulation: The practice of wrapping an object's internal data and behavior within a defined interface, and hiding the implementation details from the outside world.
- Inheritance: The ability of a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class, enabling code reuse and allowing for a hierarchical organization of classes.
- Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class, allowing code to be written in a more general and flexible way.
- Abstraction: The process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only its essential features, reducing complexity and improving the modularity of the code.
- Classes: The blueprint for creating objects, which have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
- Objects: Instances of a class, which have their own unique state and behavior.
