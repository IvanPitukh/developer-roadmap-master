# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and runtime system for APIs (application programming interfaces). It is designed to provide a flexible and efficient way for clients to request data from servers, and it is often used as an alternative to REST (representational state transfer) APIs.

One of the main features of GraphQL is its ability to specify exactly the data that is needed, rather than receiving a fixed set of data from an endpoint. This allows clients to request only the data that they need, and it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

GraphQL also provides a way to define the structure of the data that is returned from the server, allowing clients to request data in a predictable and flexible way. This makes it easier to build and maintain client applications that depend on data from the server.

GraphQL is widely used in modern web and mobile applications, and it is supported by a large and active developer community.
