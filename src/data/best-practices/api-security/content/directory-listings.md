# Directory Listings

> Turn off directory listings

Directory listings are a feature of web servers that allow users to view the contents of a directory on a server. By default, web servers often have directory listings enabled, which means that anyone who has access to the server can see all the files and directories in a given folder.

Turning off directory listings is important for API security because it prevents attackers from gaining access to sensitive files and directories on the server. If directory listings are enabled and an attacker gains access to the server, they can easily view and download any files that are not properly protected. By disabling directory listings, you can ensure that only authorized users can access the files and directories on the server.
