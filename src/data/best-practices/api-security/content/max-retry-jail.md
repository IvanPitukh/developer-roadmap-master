# Max Retry/Jail in Login

> "Max Retry" and "jail" features are commonly used in login mechanisms to enhance security and prevent brute-force attacks.

**Max Retry:** The "Max Retry" feature limits the number of login attempts that a user can make within a specified time period. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the user is locked out of their account for a specified period of time, typically several minutes or hours. This helps to prevent brute-force attacks, where an attacker attempts to guess a user's password by making repeated login attempts. By limiting the number of attempts, the system can slow down or prevent such attacks.

**Jail:** The "jail" feature involves blocking IP addresses or user accounts that have exceeded the maximum number of failed login attempts within a certain time period. The blocked IP addresses or user accounts are prevented from attempting further logins for a specified period of time, typically several minutes or hours. This helps to prevent brute-force attacks, and also provides a mechanism to prevent malicious users from repeatedly attempting to access an account or system.
