# Responsive Images

> Ensure to serve images that are close to your display size.

Small devices don't need images bigger than their viewport. It's recommended to have multiple versions of one image on different sizes.

- Create different image sizes for the devices you want to target
- Use `srcset` and `picture` to deliver multiple variants of each image.
