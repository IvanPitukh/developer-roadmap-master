# GitOps

GitOps is a set of practices for managing infrastructure and applications using Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative configuration. In Kubernetes, GitOps involves using Git as the single source of truth for both the desired and actual state of the system, automating deployment and management tasks, and often using it in conjunction with Continuous Delivery (CD) practices. The result is a more consistent, reliable, and automated approach to managing infrastructure and applications.
