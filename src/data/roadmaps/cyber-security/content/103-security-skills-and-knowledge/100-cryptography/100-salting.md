# Salting

Salting is a crucial concept within the realm of cryptography. It is a technique employed to enhance the security of passwords or equivalent sensitive data by adding an extra layer of protection to safeguard them against hacking attempts, such as brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.

## What is salting?

A _salt_ is a random string of data that is generated and combined with a user's password (or any other sensitive data) before hashing. The primary purpose of a salt is to make the hashed output of a password unique, even if two users use the exact same password. Since salts are typically randomly generated for each user, the likelihood of two users having the same salt is minimal.

## Why is salting important?

Salting is essential in enhancing password security for the following reasons:

- **Prevents the use of precomputed tables:** Attackers often use precomputed tables, such as rainbow tables or lookup tables, to efficiently crack password hashes. By introducing unique salts, these tables are rendered ineffective, as they do not account for the variations in the password hash resulting from the added salt.

- **Defends against dictionary attacks:** As salts create unique password hashes for identical passwords, attackers can no longer rely on simple dictionary attacks to crack multiple hashes simultaneously. They must instead attempt to crack each salted hash individually, which is significantly more time-consuming and resource-intensive.

## How does salting work?

When implementing salting, keep in mind the following steps:

- **Generation of a unique salt:** When a user creates or updates their password, a unique salt is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

- **Combining the salt and password:** The generated salt is then combined with the user's password through concatenation or another similar method.

- **Hashing the salt and password:** The salted password is hashed using a secure hashing algorithm, producing a unique hash output.

- **Storing the salt and hashed password:** Both the salt and hashed password are stored securely in the database alongside the user's account information. The salt is required for verifying the password during future authentication attempts.

## Best practices for salting

These suggested best practices can maximize the effectiveness of salting:

- **Use a unique salt for each user:** Generating a distinct salt for every user ensures that identical passwords yield unique password hashes.

- **Employ a secure random number generator:** Using a cryptographically secure random number generator minimizes the likelihood of pattern repetition and enhances the robustness of salts.

- **Combine salts with a strong hashing algorithm:** Pairing salting with an established and secure hashing algorithm—such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2—can significantly improve password security.

- **Consider peppering:** In addition to salting, consider incorporating a _pepper_—a secret key stored separately from the database—for extra security. Hashing a combination of the password, salt, and pepper can dramatically increase the difficulty of password hash cracking.

In summary, salting is a vital technique that enhances password security by adding a unique and random element to each password hash. This added layer of protection defends against precomputed tables and dictionary attacks, ensuring the security of user credentials in the face of persistent hacking efforts. Paired with best practices, salting can provide a robust defense against the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.
