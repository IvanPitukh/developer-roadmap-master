# Class Invariants

A class invariant is a set of conditions that must be true for any object of a class, at any point in time. In object-oriented programming (OOP), class invariants are used to define the valid states of an object and to ensure that the object always remains in a valid state.

Class invariants are typically defined in the constructor of a class and are enforced through the use of private methods and data members that are used to validate the state of the object. They are also checked in the class's methods before and after any operation that can change the state of the object.
