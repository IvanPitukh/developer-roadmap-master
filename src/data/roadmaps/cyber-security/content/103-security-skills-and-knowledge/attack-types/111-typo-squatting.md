# Typo Squatting

**Typo Squatting**, also known as **URL hijacking** or **domain squatting**, is a malicious cyber-attack technique that targets internet users who mistakenly enter an incorrect website address into their web browsers. When this occurs, the users are directed to a fake website that closely resembles a legitimate one. The attackers create these fake websites by registering domain names similar to the target website, but with common typographical errors. The goal of typo squatting is often to spread malware, steal personal information or financial details, sell counterfeit products, or promote phishing scams.

## How Typo Squatting Works

- **Domain Registration**: Attackers register domain names that are similar to popular websites, but with slight typos, such as missing or swapped characters. For example, if the intended website is `example.com`, the attacker may register `exapmle.com` or `exampl.com`.

- **Creating Fake Websites**: Attackers create a website that visually resembles the targeted website. This can include using the same logos, images, and layout, making it difficult for users to distinguish the fake site from the real one.

- **Luring Victims**: Unsuspecting users who make typographical errors while typing the URL are redirected to the fake website, where they may unknowingly provide their personal or financial information, download malware, or fall victim to phishing scams.

- **Exploitation**: Attackers may use the gathered information for identity theft, financial fraud, or sell the data on the dark web. They may also use the malware-infected devices to create botnets or perform further attacks on other targets.

## Prevention and Mitigation

- **Double-check URLs**: Always double-check the URL you type into your browser to ensure you are accessing the intended website.

- **Use Bookmarks**: Bookmark frequently visited websites to avoid typing the URL manually every time.

- **Search Engines**: If unsure about the correct URL, use search engines to locate the desired website.

- **Use Security Software**: Install and maintain up-to-date security software on your devices, such as anti-virus, anti-phishing, and anti-malware tools, to protect against potential threats from typo squatting.

- **Enable Browser Protection**: Many web browsers offer built-in security features that help identify and block malicious websites. Ensure these features are enabled and configured correctly.

In conclusion, while typo squatting presents a significant risk to internet users, awareness and vigilance can significantly reduce the chances of becoming a victim. Always verify that you're visiting the correct website before entering any personal or sensitive information.
