# Utility Types

TypeScript provides several utility types that can be used to manipulate and transform existing types. Here are some of the most common ones:

- `Partial`: makes all properties of a type optional.
- `Readonly`: makes all properties of a type read-only.
- `Pick`: allows you to pick specific properties from a type.
- `Omit`: allows you to omit specific properties from a type.
- `Exclude`: creates a type that is the set difference of A and B.
- ..and more.
