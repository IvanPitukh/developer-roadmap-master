# App Components

Android apps are primarily made up of five different types of components: 

1. **Activities**: These are individual screens that a user can interact with. Any UI action like touching a button or swiping a screen will usually take place within an activity. 

2. **Services**: Unlike activities, services run in the background and don't have a user interface. Theyâ€™re used for repetitive or long running operations, like playing music or pulling in a feed of data from a server. 

3. **Broadcast Receivers**: These are event listeners. The Android operating system uses them to respond to system-wide events. 

4. **Content Providers**: They manage and share app data with other apps installed on the device. For security, data is not generally shared across apps.

5. **Intents**: These serve as messages or commands to the Android system. They're used to signal to the Android system that certain events have occurred.
   
Each app component is designed to serve different purposes and to have a well-defined lifecycle which defines how the component is created and destroyed.
