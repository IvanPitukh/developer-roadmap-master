# Google Playstore

**Google Play Store** is the official distribution channel for Android apps and other digital media content. It is a global online software store developed and operated by Google. Developers submit their applications to Google Play through the Play Console where Google Play's automated systems scan for potentially malicious code and content violations, before they are published on the Play Store. Users can then browse, download, and use these applications on their Android devices or via the web. Purchases, downloads, and user feedback can be tracked via the Google Play Console. Owners of Android devices can also configure automatic updates for the applications they have installed from the store. This platform supports multiple languages and multiple forms of payment methods, making it accessible and customer-friendly.
