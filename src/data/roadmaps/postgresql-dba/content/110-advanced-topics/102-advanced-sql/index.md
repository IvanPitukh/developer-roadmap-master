# Advanced SQL

In this section, we'll explore some of the more advanced features of SQL that can help you take your queries and data manipulation skills to the next level. These topics will provide you with the tools you need to work with complex data structures, optimize query performance, and fine-tune your database activities.

Here are the main topics we'll cover in this Advanced SQL section:

- **Subqueries**: Subqueries allow you to use the result of one query as input for another query. We'll discuss how to use subqueries in different parts of your main query, such as the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: CTEs are temporary result sets that can be referenced in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They are particularly useful for breaking down complex queries into simpler, more readable parts.

- **Window Functions**: Window functions enable you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. This is useful for tasks like ranking, cumulative sums, and moving averages.

- **Pivot Tables**: Pivot tables help you reorganize data from long format to wide format (or vice versa). This can make it easier to analyze and summarize data in a meaningful way.

- **Advanced Joins**: We'll dive deeper into SQL joins by exploring various types of joins such as Self Joins, Lateral Joins, and CROSS JOIN.

- **Full-Text Search**: Full-text search allows you to query natural language documents stored in your database. We'll look at using PostgreSQLâ€™s built-in text search features, including the tsvector and tsquery data types, as well as text search functions and operators.

- **Triggers**: Triggers are a way to automatically execute a specified function whenever certain events occur, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or TRUNCATE operations. We will look at creating triggers and understanding their use cases.

- **Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures are reusable, precompiled units of code that can be called by applications to perform specific database tasks. We'll discuss creating and invoking stored procedures, and we'll also touch on how they compare to functions in PostgreSQL.

- **Performance Optimization**: To ensure your PostgreSQL database is running efficiently, it's essential to optimize query performance. We'll highlight some strategies, including indexing, query optimization, and server configuration, to improve efficiency and speed.

By the end of this section on Advanced SQL, you should have a deeper understanding of these powerful SQL features and techniques that will help you manipulate, analyze, and maintain your data more effectively.
