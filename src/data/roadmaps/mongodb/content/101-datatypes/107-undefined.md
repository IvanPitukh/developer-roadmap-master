# Undefined

In this section, we will discuss the "undefined" datatype in MongoDB. This datatype was originally used in the early versions of MongoDB, but now it is deprecated and should not be used in new applications.

## What is 'undefined'?

An 'undefined' datatype in MongoDB is a data type that signifies that the value of a field has not been set or has been removed. It represents the absence of a value.

## Why should it not be used?

In the newer versions of MongoDB, it is recommended to use the `null` value for representing missing or undefined values in the database. Although the `undefined` datatype is still supported for backward compatibility, it is advised to avoid the use of it, as the `null` value is more widely accepted and understood.

Here is an example to show the difference between `null` and `undefined`:

```javascript
{
  "field1": null,
  "field2": undefined
}
```

In this example, `field1` has a `null` value, while `field2` has an `undefined` value. However, it is recommended to use `null` instead of `undefined` to maintain better readability and compatibility.

## Conclusion

In summary, while the 'undefined' datatype exists in MongoDB, it is now considered deprecated and should be avoided. Instead, it is suggested to use the `null` value to represent fields with missing or undefined values in your database. This will ensure better compatibility and readability of your code when using MongoDB.
