# RecycleView

The `RecyclerView` is an enhanced version of the `ListView` and the `GridView`. It is a more advanced and flexible version of `ListView`. In `RecyclerView`, there are several different components that work together to display your data. The `RecyclerView.Adapter` is similar to the `BaseAdapter`; it takes data and turns it into views that can be inserted in the `RecyclerView` layout. On the other hand, the `RecyclerView.LayoutManager` helps positioning items inside the `RecyclerView` and determining the behavior when scrolling. A third significant component is `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`. It provides references to the views for each data item which help to reduce unnecessary calls to `findViewById()`. It's also important to mention that the `RecyclerView` class supports not only lists but also a custom implementation of horizontal or vertical lists, grids, or staggered grids while offering more opportunities for fantastic custom animations.
