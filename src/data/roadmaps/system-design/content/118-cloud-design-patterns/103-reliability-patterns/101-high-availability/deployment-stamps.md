# Deployment Stamps

The Bulkhead pattern is a type of application design that is tolerant of failure. In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. It's named after the sectioned partitions (bulkheads) of a ship's hull. If the hull of a ship is compromised, only the damaged section fills with water, which prevents the ship from sinking.
