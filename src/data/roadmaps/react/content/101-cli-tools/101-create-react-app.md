# Create React App

Create React App is the CLI based tool and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.
