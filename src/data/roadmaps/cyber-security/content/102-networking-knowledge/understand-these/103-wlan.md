# WLAN

A **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** is a type of local area network that uses wireless communication to connect devices, such as computers and smartphones, within a specific area. Unlike a wired network, which requires physical cables to establish connections, WLANs facilitate connections through radio frequency (RF) signals, providing a more flexible networking option.

## Key Components of WLAN

There are two main components in a WLAN:

- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: A WAP is a networking device that enables wireless devices to connect to the network. It acts as a bridge between the devices and the wired network, converting RF signals into data that can travel through a wired connection.
- **Wireless Client**: Wireless clients are devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets that are fitted with WLAN adapters. These adapters enable devices to send and receive wireless signals to connect with the WAP.

## Key WLAN Standards

There are several WLAN standards, defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 series. Some of the most common standards include:

- **802.11a**: Supports throughput up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz frequency band.
- **802.11b**: Supports throughput up to 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.
- **802.11g**: Supports throughput up to 54 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and is backward compatible with 802.11b.
- **802.11n**: Supports throughput up to 600 Mbps and operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
- **802.11ac**: Supports throughput up to several Gigabits per second and operates in the 5 GHz frequency band. This is currently the most widely adopted standard.

## WLAN Security

As WLANs use wireless signals to transmit data, they can be susceptible to various security threats. Some essential security measures include:

- **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)**: An early security protocol that uses encryption to protect wireless communications. Due to several security flaws, it has been replaced by more secure protocols.

- **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)**: WPA is an enhanced security protocol that addressed the vulnerabilities of WEP. It uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption and provides better authentication and encryption methods.

- **Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)**: WPA2 is an advanced security protocol that uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and replaces TKIP from WPA. This protocol provides a high level of security and is currently the recommended standard for securing WLANs.

- **Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)**: WPA3 is the latest security standard with enhanced encryption and authentication features. It addresses the vulnerabilities in WPA2 and provides even stronger security for WLANs.

To maintain a secure WLAN, it's essential to use the appropriate security standard, change default settings, and regularly update firmware to address any security vulnerabilities.
