# Exception Handling

Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

There are three types of exceptions -

1. Checked Exception - exceptions checked at compile time. Example - IOException
2. Unchecked Exception - exceptions checked at run time. Example - NullPointerException
3. Error - It is irrecoverable. Example - OutOfMemoryError
