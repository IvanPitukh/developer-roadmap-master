# Apollo Client

Apollo Client is a popular JavaScript library for building client applications that consume GraphQL APIs. It is developed and maintained by the Apollo team and is widely used in the industry.

Apollo Client provides a set of features that make it easy to interact with a GraphQL server, such as querying, mutating, and subscribing to data. It also provides a caching system to store the results of previous queries, which improves the performance of the application.
