# Dynamics

**Dynamics** in game physics refers to the calculation and simulation of the movement and interaction of objects over time, taking into account properties such as mass, force, and velocity. Its purpose is to ensure the motion of game elements matches expectations in the real-world, or the specific conditions defined by the game designers. This typically includes topics like kinematics (velocity and acceleration), Newton's laws of motion, forces (like gravity or friction), and conservation laws (such as momentum or energy). This also involves solving equations of motions for the game objects, detecting collisions and resolving them. Dynamics, together with Statics (dealing with how forces balance on rigid bodies at rest), makes up the core of game physics simulation.
