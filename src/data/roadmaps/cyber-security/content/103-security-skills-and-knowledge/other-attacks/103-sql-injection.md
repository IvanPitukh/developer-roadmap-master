# SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a type of cyber attack that targets web applications and databases. This technique takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the application's code by injecting malicious SQL statements and exploiting them to gain unauthorized access or to manipulate the data in a database. Attackers can potentially use this technique to retrieve, modify, delete, or even add data to the database without proper authorization.

## How SQL Injection Works

SQL Injection works by identifying input fields in a web application, such as text boxes or URL parameters, and testing whether these fields are vulnerable to SQL code injection. When an attacker identifies a vulnerable input field, they inject SQL code to manipulate the underlying SQL query or to execute additional queries on the database.

For example, consider a web application that allows users to log in by providing a username and password. The application might use the following SQL query to authenticate the user:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'
```

In this case, `$username` and `$password` are replaced with the values provided by the user. If an attacker enters the following input for the username field, they can manipulate the query to bypass the password check:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

The resulting query would look like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 -- ' AND password = '$password'
```

As `1=1` is always true, the query returns a result, and the attacker gains unauthorized access.

## Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

To protect your web applications from SQL Injection attacks, you should:

- **Use Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements**: These techniques separate user input from the SQL query, making it harder for an attacker to inject malicious code. Most modern web development frameworks and database libraries support parameterized queries and prepared statements.

- **Validate User Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into a SQL query. Use strict data types and validate input against predefined patterns or value ranges.

- **Limit Database Permissions**: Limit the privileges of the database accounts used by your web applications. This confines the potential damage if an attacker manages to perform an SQL injection attack.

- **Keep Software Up-to-Date**: Regularly update your web application software and database management systems to ensure that you are protected against known vulnerabilities.

By understanding SQL Injection attacks and employing the best practices to prevent them, you can safeguard your web applications and secure your sensitive data from malicious actors.
