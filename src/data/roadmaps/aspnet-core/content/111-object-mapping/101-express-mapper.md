# Express Mapper

ExpressMapper is an open-source object-to-object mapping library for .NET, similar to AutoMapper. It allows you to easily map between objects of different types, and it is particularly useful when working with domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) in a layered architecture.

ExpressMapper uses a convention-based approach to mapping, which means that it automatically maps properties with the same name and type from one object to another. It also provides a fluent API for configuring more complex mappings, such as ignoring certain properties, using custom logic to map properties, or mapping properties based on a value in another property.
