# Mutations

In GraphQL, a mutation is a type of query used to make changes to the data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting data. A mutation is structured similarly to a query, but with a "mutation" field at the top level instead of a "query" field.

The mutation includes fields that specify the data to be changed, the operation to be performed (create, update or delete) and also can include arguments to specify the specific data to be affected.
