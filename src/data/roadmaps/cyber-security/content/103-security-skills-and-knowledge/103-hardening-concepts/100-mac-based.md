# MAC-based

_Mandatory Access Control (MAC)_ is a robust security model when it comes to hardening, as it enforces strict policies on operating systems and applications regarding system access. In MAC-based hardening, the end-users are not allowed to modify access controls on your system.

## How MAC-based Hardening Works

Typical MAC mechanisms work based on predefined security attributes or labels. These labels determine access permissions and are integrated within the system to classify data, resources, and users. Once these labels are in place, the operating system or a trusted security kernel rigorously enforces the constraints on how they access data.

## Benefits of MAC-Based Hardening

MAC-based hardening offers numerous benefits for organizations seeking to improve their cybersecurity posture:

- **Enforced Security Policies**: MAC policies can be pre-configured in accordance with your organization's security requirements, ensuring consistency on all systems.
- **Limited Access**: Users have limited access to resources, which reduces the potential for insider threats and accidental leaks of sensitive data.
- **Protection of Sensitive Data**: By preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data, MAC-based hardening helps protect against data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.
- **Auditing and Compliance**: MAC-based hardening mechanisms help facilitate audits and compliance with industry regulations.

## Popular MAC-based Models

There are various MAC models implemented in modern software systems. Some of the most popular models include:

- **Bell-LaPadula (BLP) Model**: Designed for confidentiality, the BLP Model enforces the "no read up, no write down" rule, meaning that users may only read data at the same or lower levels of sensitivity, while only allowing data to be written to the same or higher levels of sensitivity.
- **Biba Model**: Focusing on integrity, the Biba Model enforces the "no write up, no read down" rule, which works opposite to BLP Model.
- **Clark-Wilson Model**: The Clark-Wilson Model emphasizes well-formed transactions, separation of duties, and certification processes to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

## Implementing MAC-Based Hardening

To implement MAC-based hardening, it's important to follow these general steps:

- **Establish Security Policies**: Define clear policies and guidelines, including security labels, for the various data classifications, users, and resources.
- **Select an Appropriate MAC Model**: Choose a MAC model suitable for your organization's needs and implement it across your systems.
- **Train Staff**: Provide training to your staff to ensure understanding and adherence to your organization's MAC-based policies.
- **Monitor and Audit**: Continually monitor the system for deviations from the MAC policies and perform periodic audits to verify their enforcement.

In summary, MAC-based hardening offers robust access controls by enforcing strict policies in accordance with your organization's security requirements. In doing so, it reduces the potential for unauthorized access to data and resources, ultimately enhancing your cybersecurity posture.
