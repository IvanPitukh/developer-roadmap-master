# Switch

A `Switch` is a core component in React Native used to implement a "toggle" or "on-off" input. It provides a UI for the user to switch between two different states, typically true or false. The primary use case is to enable or disable a feature or setting within an application.

`Switch` component has a boolean `value` prop (true for on, false for off) and an `onValueChange` event handler, which is triggered whenever the user toggles the switch.

Here's an example of how to use `Switch` in a React Native application:

```jsx
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import {View, Switch, Text} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = useState(false);

  const toggleSwitch = () => setIsEnabled(previousState => !previousState);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Enable Feature:</Text>
      <Switch
     trackColor={{ false: "#767577", true: "#81b0ff" }}
     thumbColor={isEnabled ? "#f5dd4b" : "#f4f3f4"}
      onValueChange={toggleSwitch}
      value={isEnabled}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, `Switch` component's `value` prop is set to the state hook `isEnabled`. The `onValueChange` event handler triggers `toggleSwitch` function, which updates the state of `isEnabled`. The colors for the track and thumb of the switch can be customized using `trackColor` and `thumbColor` props.
