# Literal Types

Literal types in TypeScript are a way to specify a value exactly, rather than just a type. Literal types can be used to enforce that a value must be of a specific type and a specific value. Literal types are created by using a literal value, such as a string, number, or boolean, as a type.

For example, the following is a literal type that represents a value of 42:

```typescript
type Age = 42;

let age: Age = 42; // ok
let age: Age = 43; // error
```

In this example, the `Age` literal type is created by using the number `42` as a type. This type can then be used to enforce that a value must be of type `number` and have the value `42`.
