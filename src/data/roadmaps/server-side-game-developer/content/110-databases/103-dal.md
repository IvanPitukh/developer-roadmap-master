# DAL

The term **DAL** stands for **Data Access Layer**. It represents a layer of an application that simplifies the interaction with the persistent storage of data. Typically, the DAL is implemented in a separate module, package, or library in your application that directly communicates with the database, thereby enabling the application services and modules to invoke a simple API for CRUD operations (Create, retrieve, update, and delete database entries) and database transactions. The DAL helps maintain the applicationâ€™s database schema and manage connections to the database. Popular libraries and frameworks like SQLAlchemy for Python, Sequelize for Node.js, and Hibernate for Java among others provide a robust DAL implementation. These tools abstract the lower-level details of the data source into a higher-level programming interface.
