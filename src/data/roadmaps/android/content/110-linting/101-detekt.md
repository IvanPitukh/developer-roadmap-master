# Detekt

`Detekt` is a static code analysis tool for the Kotlin programming language. It operates on the abstract syntax tree provided by the Kotlin compiler and can run in the command line or as a task in your Gradle build script. Detekt provides complexity reports that can be used to identify overly complex code and help simplify it. It also checks for a variety of potential bugs and code smells, including issues with formatting, naming conventions, exception handling, and more. Moreover, Detekt is highly configurable, allowing you to enable, disable, or modify the behavior of its checks to suit your project's needs.
