# Determinism

"Determinism" in the context of server side game development is a principle that highlights predictability and consistency in the system's output given specific and consistent inputs. It implies that a system will always produce the same outcome if the initial conditions and the sequence of events leading up to the outcome are identical. Determinism is incredibly important and beneficial in multi-player gaming situations like MMORPGs where synchronized and equal gameplay across all user instances is key. This level of predictibility helps in offering a fair play environment to all players and in ease of debugging and replaying certain sequences for the developers.
