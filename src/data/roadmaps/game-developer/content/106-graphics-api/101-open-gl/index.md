# OpenGL

Open GL, also known as Open Graphics Library, is a cross-language, cross-platform API designed to render 2D and 3D vector graphics. As a software interface for graphics hardware, Open GL provides programmers the ability to create complex graphics visuals in detail. It was first developed by Silicon Graphics Inc. in 1992 and quickly became a highly popular tool in the graphics rendering industry. Open GL is widely used in CAD, virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, and flight simulation. It is also used in video games production where real-time rendering is a requirement. The API is designed to work with a broad range of hardware from different manufacturers. Being open-source, Open GL's code capabilities can be extended by anyone in the software community.
