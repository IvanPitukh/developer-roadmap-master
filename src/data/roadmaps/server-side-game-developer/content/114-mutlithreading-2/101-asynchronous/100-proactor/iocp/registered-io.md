# Registered IO

`Registered I/O (RIO)` is an advanced Windows technology which is used to increase the performance of network applications. It offers a registered I/O buffer design that is designed for high volume, low latency networking applications. This programming model allows more efficient buffer usage by restricting dynamism and enabling more driver and hardware offloads. RIO's API can be used with any Winsock supported protocol, although its efficiency is greatest with protocols that can leverage offloads (like TCP and UDP). It requires Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or newer versions. It should be noted that it requires significant program modifications as well as in depth understanding of IOCP and how itâ€™s used by Windows networking APIs usually involving complex, low level programming.
