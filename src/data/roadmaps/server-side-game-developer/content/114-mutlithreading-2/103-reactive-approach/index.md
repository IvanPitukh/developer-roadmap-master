# Reactive Approach

In the realm of server-side game development, the reactive approach is an important element when dealing with multithreading. This approach is based on the concept of reacting to changes or events happening in the system rather than calling methods or running operations continuously. It incorporates observables, which are objects that represent a stream of data or a series of events, and observers, which are methods that respond to the events or changes in these observables. Reactive programming is based on the observer pattern and is designed to handle asynchronous data calls and events efficiently. This pattern is particularly relevant in situations with a large amount of data, high level of complexity, or stringent real-time requirements. With this approach, it is also simpler to handle concurrency and to write programs that are efficient, clean, and less prone to errors and callback pyramids.
