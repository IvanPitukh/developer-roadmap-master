# Sourcemaps

Sourcemaps are files that map the original source code of a project to its minified or transpiled version. This is especially useful in environments, like React Native, where the code may be transformed before being executed in the device/emulator. Sourcemaps help developers to debug their code more easily by mapping errors in the transformed code back to their original location in the source code. 

There are various types of sourcemaps which give different levels of detail to the debugging process:

- `eval`: Uses `eval` function to generate the sourcemaps. This is faster but provides less detailed information than other options.
- `cheap-source-map`: Simple line-to-line mapping without column information. Faster than `source-map` but less accurate.
- `cheap-module-source-map`: Similar to `cheap-source-map` but with support for modules.
- `source-map`: Full source mapping with both line and column information. It is accurate, though slower compared to other options.

After generating sourcemaps, you can use them to debug errors more efficiently, as they will reference the original locations in the source code. The browser's developer tools, like Google Chrome, have built-in support for sourcemaps, providing the ability to navigate and debug errors with ease.
