# Software Design Principles

There are many software design principles that aim to guide the development of software in a way that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Some of the most common design principles include:

- SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- LoD (Law of Demeter)
- Composition over Inheritance
- Encapsulate What Varies
- Hollywood Principle
- Program Against Abstractions

By following these design principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs.
