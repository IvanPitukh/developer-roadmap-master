# Tensor Flow

**TensorFlow** is an open-source, end-to-end platform initially developed by Google Brain Team. Focusing on machine learning and equipped to handle deep learning tasks, TensorFlow takes input as a multi-dimensional array also known as a 'tensor'. The framework allows developers to create dataflow graphs. These graphs describe how data moves in a computing unit, be it a machine or a cloud. Within the graph, nodes represent mathematical operations while edges symbolize the tensors. TensorFlow is highly scalable and allows for computations across multiple CPUs or GPUs, making it appropriate for various tasks - be it server-side game development or research.
