# Model Driven Design

Model-driven design (MDD) is a software development methodology in which the design of a system is represented by a set of models, and the models are used to drive the development of the system. MDD is based on the idea that the design of a system can be represented by a set of models, and that these models can be used to generate the code for the system.

The main advantage of using MDD is that it allows for a clear separation of concerns between the design and implementation of a system. The models represent the design of the system, and the code is generated from the models, which makes it easier to maintain and evolve the system. Additionally, MDD can also improve the quality of the code, as the models can be used to check for design errors and inconsistencies before the code is generated.
