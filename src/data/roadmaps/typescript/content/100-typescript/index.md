# TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript was created to address the challenges of building large-scale JavaScript applications and adds optional type annotations, classes, interfaces, and other features to the language.

The main benefits of using TypeScript include:

- Type Safety
- Improved Tooling
- Improved Maintainability
- Backwards Compatibility
