# Cloud

Cloud in the context of ASP.NET refers to the use of cloud computing services to host and run ASP.NET web applications. Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources (such as servers, storage, and applications) over the internet on a pay-per-use basis.

In the case of ASP.NET, cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer services specifically tailored to host and run ASP.NET web applications. These services include virtual machines, web roles, and serverless computing, which can be used to deploy and run ASP.NET web applications in the cloud.
