# Parallax

Parallax is a powerful technique employed in game development to establish depth in 2D games. The term 'Parallax' comes from the Greek word 'parallaxis', which means alteration. In game development, parallax creates an illusion of depth by making background images move slower compared to the foreground images when the player moves. This is due to the phenomenon where objects that are farther away seem to move at a slower speed compared to closer ones. There are different types of parallax techniques like the traditional parallax scrolling, multi-layered parallax, and parallax mapping. Parallax Mapping, also known as offset mapping or virtual displacement mapping, is a method used to fake details on a surface to give the illusion of depth or surface irregularities.
