# Minify CSS

> All CSS files are minified, comments, white spaces and new lines are removed from production files.

When CSS files are minified, the content is loaded faster and less data is sent to the client. It's important to always minify CSS files in production. It is beneficial for the user as it is for any business who wants to lower bandwidth costs and lower resource usage.

Use tools to minify your files automatically before or during your build or your deployment.
