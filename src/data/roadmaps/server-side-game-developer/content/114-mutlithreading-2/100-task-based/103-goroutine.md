# goroutine (Go)

`Goroutine` is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. They are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods in the Go programming language. Goroutines are cheaper than threads as they use less memory, and their creation and destruction are more efficient in terms of performance. Unlike threads in other languages, the Go runtime manages the scheduling of Goroutines, taking a lot of the complexities away from the developer. Goroutines are one of the unique features of Go, making it an excellent choice for concurrent programming, especially useful in server-side game development.
