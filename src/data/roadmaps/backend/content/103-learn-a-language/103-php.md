# PHP

PHP is a general purpose scripting language often used for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group and supported by PHP Foundation. PHP supports procedural and object-oriented styles of programming with some elements of functional programming as well.
