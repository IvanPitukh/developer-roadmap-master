# Capacitor

Since Vue.js is a web framework, it does not natively support mobile app development. So how do we get access to native mobile features such as the camera and geolocation? Ionic has an official native runtime called Capacitor. With Capacitorâ€™s plugin, you can access the native API of the device your app is running on and build truly native mobile application with Ionic Vue.
