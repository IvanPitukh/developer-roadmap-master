# Java

Java is a popular programming language used for Android development due to its robustness and ease of use. Its object-oriented structure allows developers to create modular programs and reusable code. The language was built with the philosophy of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on all platforms without the need for recompilation. Androidâ€™s API and core libraries are primarily written in Java, therefore understanding Java is fundamental in creating diverse and powerful Android apps. Java is a statically-typed language, which can be beneficial for detecting errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. Oracle, who owns Java, provides comprehensive documentation and support for the language.
