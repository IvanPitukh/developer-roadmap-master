The **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** is a highly respected and sought-after certification in the field of cybersecurity. This certification is designed to test your practical knowledge and skills in the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities in a target environment, as well as your ability to effectively implement offensive security techniques to assess the security posture of networks and systems.

## Key Topics Covered:

- Penetration testing methodologies
- Advanced information gathering techniques
- Buffer overflow attacks
- Web application attacks
- Various exploitation techniques
- Privilege escalation
- Client-side attacks
- Post-exploitation techniques
- Basic scripting and automation

## Prerequisites:

There are no strict prerequisites for the OSCP, but it is recommended that candidates have a solid understanding of networking, system administration, and Linux/Unix command-line environments. Familiarity with basic programming concepts, scripting languages (e.g., Python, Bash), and operating system concepts will also be helpful.

## Exam Format:

To obtain the OSCP certification, you must successfully complete the 24-hour hands-on exam, where you are required to attack and penetrate a target network, compromising several machines and completing specific objectives within the given time frame.

Before attempting the exam, candidates must complete the accompanying training course, **Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK)**, which provides the necessary knowledge and practical experience required for the OSCP exam.
