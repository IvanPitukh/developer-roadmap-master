# iostream

`iostream` is a header in the C++ Standard Library that provides functionality for basic input and output (I/O) operations. The I/O streams facilitate communication between your program and various sources, such as the console, files, or other programs.

`iostream` includes the following classes:

- `istream`: for input operations from an input source.
- `ostream`: for output operations to an output target.
- `iostream`: a combination of `istream` and `ostream` for both input and output operations.

These classes inherit from base classes `ios` and `ios_base`.

Additionally, `iostream` defines several objects that are instances of these classes and represent the standard input and output streams:

- `cin`: an `istream` object to read from the standard input, typically corresponding to the keyboard.
- `cout`: an `ostream` object to write to the standard output, typically the console.
- `cerr`: an `ostream` object to write to the standard error output, typically used for displaying error messages.
- `clog`: an `ostream` object, similar to `cerr`, but its output can be buffered.

Here are some code examples on using `iostream` for input and output operations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> a;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << a << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cerr << "An error occurred." << std::endl;
    std::clog << "Logging information." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Remember to include the `iostream` header when using these features:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
