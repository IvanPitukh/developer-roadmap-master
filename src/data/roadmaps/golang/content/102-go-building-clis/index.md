# Building CLI Applications

Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.

Go applications are built into a single self contained binary making installing Go applications trivial; specifically, programs written in Go run on any system without requiring any existing libraries, runtimes, or dependencies. And programs written in Go have an immediate startup timeâ€”similar to C or C++ but unobtainable with other programming languages.
