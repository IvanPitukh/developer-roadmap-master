# Spatial Partitioning

"Spatial partitioning" is a technique used in computational geometry, intended to make calculations involving objects in space more efficient. It involves dividing a large virtual space into a series of smaller spaces, or "partitions". These partitions can be used to quickly eliminate areas that are irrelevant to a particular calculation or query, thus lowering the overall computational cost. This technique is widely used in game development in contexts such as collision detection, rendering, pathfinding, and more. Various methods exist for spatial partitioning, including grid-based, tree-based (like Quadtree and Octree), and space-filling curve (like Z-order or Hilbert curve) approaches.
