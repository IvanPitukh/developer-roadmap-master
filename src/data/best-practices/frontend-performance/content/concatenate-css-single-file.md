# CSS Concatenation

> CSS files are concatenated in a single file (Not always valid for HTTP/2)

If you are still using HTTP/1, you may need to still concatenate your files, it's less true if your server use HTTP/2 (tests should be made).

- Use online tool or any plugin before or during your build or your deployment to concatenate your files.
- Ensure, of course, that concatenation does not break your project
