# PgBouncer

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooling solution for PostgreSQL databases. It efficiently manages database connections by maintaining a small pool of connections that are reused by the application. This results in reduced overhead and improved performance when establishing and tearing down connections, allowing applications to scale more effectively.

PgBouncer acts as a middleware between the application and the PostgreSQL server. It listens to application connection requests, then forwards them to the appropriate PostgreSQL server instance after managing the connection pool. This approach helps to balance loads on the database server and helps avoid excessively high numbers of idle connections.

## Features of PgBouncer

- **Lesser latency**: PgBouncer has minimal overhead, which allows applications to connect to the database almost instantly.
- **Multi-pool modes**: Supports three pooling modes - session pooling, transaction pooling, and statement pooling, which can be tuned to match specific use cases.
- **Scalability**: Supports high number of connections, making it suitable for applications with a high number of concurrent users.
- **Security**: Supports TLS/SSL encryption for secure client-to-PgBouncer and PgBouncer-to-PostgreSQL connections.
- **Connection Limits**: Allows setting connection limits at various levels, such as global, per database, or per user.

## Installing and Configuring PgBouncer

To install PgBouncer, follow the instructions outlined in the [official documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/install.html). After installation, you will need to configure `pgbouncer.ini` file to define database connection parameters, connection pool settings, and other configurations. An example configuration could look like this:

```ini
[databases]
mydb = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
listen_port = 6432
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /path/to/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
pool_mode = session
server_reset_query = DISCARD ALL
max_client_conn = 100
default_pool_size = 20
```

The example above demonstrates a simple configuration to set up a PgBouncer instance listening on port 6432 and forwarding connections to a PostgreSQL server running on the same machine (localhost:5432).

After configuring PgBouncer, don't forget to create the `userlist.txt` file mentioned in the `auth_file` setting, which should contain the database users and their hashed passwords.

Finally, start the PgBouncer daemon to enable connection pooling.
