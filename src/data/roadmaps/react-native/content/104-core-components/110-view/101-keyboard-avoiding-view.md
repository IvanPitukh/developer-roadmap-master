# KeyboardAvoidingView

`KeyboardAvoidingView` is a built-in React Native component that automatically adjusts its children components' position when the keyboard opens, preventing them from being obscured by the on-screen keyboard. It's a useful component, particularly for forms and input fields where the user needs to see the text they're typing.

## Usage

To use the `KeyboardAvoidingView`, simply wrap the desired components that need to avoid the keyboard with the `KeyboardAvoidingView` component. The prop `behavior` is used to specify the type of animating behavior the component will use. This behavior differs depending on the platform and can be one of 'height', 'position', 'padding', or a custom defined behavior.

Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, StyleSheet, KeyboardAvoidingView } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView
      style={styles.container}
      behavior="padding" // Additional padding when the keyboard is open.
    >
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Type something here"
        style={styles.textInput}
      />
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  textInput: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: 'black',
    padding: 10,
    margin: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

Remember to test the behavior on different devices and platforms to ensure the desired result is achieved.
