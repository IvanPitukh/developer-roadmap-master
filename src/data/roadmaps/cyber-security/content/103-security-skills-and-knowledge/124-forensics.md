# Understand Basics of Forensics

**Forensics** is a specialized area within cybersecurity that deals with the investigation of cyber incidents, the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence, and the efforts to tie this evidence to specific cyber actors. The main goal of digital forensics is to identify the cause of an incident, determine the extent of the damage, and provide necessary information to recover and prevent future attacks. This discipline typically involves several key steps:

- **Preparation**: Developing a forensic strategy, setting up a secure laboratory environment, and ensuring the forensics team has the necessary skills and tools.
- **Identification**: Determining the scope of the investigation, locating and identifying the digital evidence, and documenting any relevant information.
- **Preservation**: Ensuring the integrity of the digital evidence is maintained by creating backups, securing storage, and applying legal and ethical guidelines.
- **Analysis**: Examining the digital evidence using specialized tools and techniques to extract relevant information, identify patterns, and uncover hidden details.
- **Reporting**: Compiling the findings of the investigation into a report that provides actionable insights, including the identification of cyber actors, the methods used, and the damage caused.

Professionals working in digital forensics need a solid understanding of various technologies, as well as the ability to think critically, be detail-oriented, and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data. Moreover, they should be well-versed in related laws and regulations to ensure compliance and admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings. Some of the key skills to master include:

- Knowledge of digital evidence collection and preservation techniques
- Familiarity with forensic tools and software, such as EnCase, FTK, or Autopsy
- Understanding of file systems, operating systems, and network protocols
- Knowledge of malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Effective communication abilities to convey technical findings to non-technical stakeholders

Overall, digital forensics is a crucial component of cybersecurity as it helps organizations respond effectively to cyber attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and take appropriate steps to safeguard their digital assets.
