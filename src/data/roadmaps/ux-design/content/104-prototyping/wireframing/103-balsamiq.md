# Balsamiq

Balsamiq is a popular wireframing tool that helps designers, developers, and product managers to quickly create and visualize user interfaces, web pages, or app screens. It's an easy-to-use software that allows you to focus on ideas and concepts rather than getting caught up in pixel-perfect designs.

- _Built-in UI Components:_ Balsamiq has a wide variety of pre-designed UI components, which help you quickly create wireframes for different platforms like web, mobile, and desktop applications.
