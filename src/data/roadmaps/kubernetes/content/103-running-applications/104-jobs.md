# Jobs

a Job is a controller that manages the execution of a finite task or batch job. Jobs are used to run short-lived tasks, such as batch processing, data analysis, or backups, that run to completion and then terminate. Jobs create one or more pods to run the task, and they monitor the completion status of each pod. If a pod fails or terminates, the Job automatically creates a replacement pod to ensure that the task is completed successfully. Jobs are defined by a YAML file that includes a pod template, completion criteria, and other settings.
