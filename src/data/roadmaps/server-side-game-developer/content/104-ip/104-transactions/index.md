# Transactions

In server-side game development, **transactions** are critical elements that facilitate the exchange or interaction between different processes and data streams. These are usually carried out via a database or a server and are atomically treated as a single unit of work, ensuring data consistency and integrity. Transactions follow a specific pattern known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) which makes sure that all intended operations within a transaction are successfully performed or none of them are, preventing disruptions in the event of an error or failure. It also ensures that concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be achieved if transactions were executed sequentially. It's important for a server-side game developer to understand how to manage and control transactions to maintain the robustness of the game's backend system.
