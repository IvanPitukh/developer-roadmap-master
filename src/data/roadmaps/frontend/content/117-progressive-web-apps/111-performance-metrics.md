# Performance Metrics

Web performance metrics are quantitative measures of the performance of a web page or application. They are used to assess the speed and efficiency of a web page, and they can help identify areas for improvement. Some common web performance metrics include:

- Load time: The time it takes for a web page to fully load and become interactive.
- First contentful paint (FCP): The time it takes for the first content to appear on the page.
- Time to interactive (TTI): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
- First input delay (FID): The time it takes for the page to respond to the first user input.
- Total blocking time (TBT): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, taking into account the time spent blocking the main thread.

There are many tools and techniques available for measuring web performance metrics, including browser dev tools, performance monitoring tools, and web performance APIs. By tracking these metrics and analyzing the results, web developers can identify areas for improvement and optimize the performance of their web pages.
