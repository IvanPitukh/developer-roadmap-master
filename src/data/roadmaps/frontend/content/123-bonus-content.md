# Bonus Content

It is not required to complete the bonus content, it just expands on the topics covered in the roadmap and has the items which were missed in the roadmap. Go through them if you want.

- **UI / UX Knowledge** - Gaining UI/UX knowledge is not a must for a Frontend Developer but having an eye for design and a good understanding of UI/UX will help you in your career.
- **[Design Systems](/design-system)** - Learn how to create and work with design systems.
- **Visual Programming** — it is entirely possible to be a successful, competent frontend developer without it, but for many frontend developers this path represents a serious chunk of their workload, and represents a very in-demand option for frontend development – especially for developers who have a visual aptitude.
  - **For Animations**: [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/), [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) or [MoJs](https://mojs.github.io/)
  - **Web Graphics Library (WebGL)**: [WebGL MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial), [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fundamentals.html)
  - **2D Graphics**: [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/)
  - **3D Graphics**: [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
- Have a look at [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) and **[Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/)**.
- [Houdini](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Houdini) — Here is a good [introductory article to houdini](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/practical-overview-css-houdini/).
- **[WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)** - WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.
- **[IDLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IDL)** - Not every developer will have a need for understanding [IDLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IDL) but there's a good argument for having more JavaScript developers aware of their existence and hopefully the ability for making use of them as well.
- **[WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)** - WebAssembly is a comparatively new technology that allows you to run code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web. It's a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.
