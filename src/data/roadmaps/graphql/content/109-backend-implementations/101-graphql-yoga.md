GraphQL Yoga is a popular open-source GraphQL server library for Node.js. It is built on top of the popular Express.js web framework and provides a simple and flexible way to build GraphQL servers with minimal boilerplate code.

One of the key features of GraphQL Yoga is that it provides a set of built-in functionality that makes it easy to handle common tasks such as authentication, authorization, and data validation.
