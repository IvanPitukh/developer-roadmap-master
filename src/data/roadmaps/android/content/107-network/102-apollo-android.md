# Apollo-Android

**Apollo Android** is a set of tools for using GraphQL with Android, made by the Apollo community developers. It's fully written in Kotlin and it was designed to seamlessly integrate with any Android app, making fetching data across network and handling data in the client-side a breeze. Apollo Android runs your queries and mutations and returns results as generated Kotlin types. It also normalizes your data and caches your results for further speed enhancements. It operates both on Android and Kotlin/JVM backend environment. It's also coroutines-first making handling concurrency easy and effective. To use Apollo Android, you'll set up the plugin, point it at your GraphQL schema, and write GraphQL queries.
