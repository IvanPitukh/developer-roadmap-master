# PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley. It has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open-source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems and has been ACID-compliant since 2001. It has powerful add-ons like the popular PostGIS geospatial database extender. It can handle ranges, array types and has extensive capabilities for developing at scale.
