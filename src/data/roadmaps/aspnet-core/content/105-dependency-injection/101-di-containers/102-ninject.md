# Ninject

Ninject is an open-source dependency injection framework for .NET. It is designed to make it easier to manage the dependencies of an application by automatically resolving and managing the lifetime of objects and their dependencies.

Ninject uses a technique called "binding" to define the objects and dependencies of an application. This is done by creating instances of the `StandardKernel` class and using its methods to register types, instances and factories. Then, the `Get()` method is called to resolve the dependencies throughout the application.
