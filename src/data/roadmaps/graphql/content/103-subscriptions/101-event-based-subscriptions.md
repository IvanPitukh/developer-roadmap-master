# Event Based Subscriptions

Event-based subscriptions in GraphQL are a way to push real-time updates to the client based on specific events that occur on the server. These events can be triggered by external sources such as user actions, sensor data, or other systems, or by internal actions such as database updates.

With event-based subscriptions, the client can subscribe to a specific event or set of events and receive updates in real-time as soon as the event occurs. This allows the client to receive notifications about important changes in the system without the need to constantly poll the server for updates.
