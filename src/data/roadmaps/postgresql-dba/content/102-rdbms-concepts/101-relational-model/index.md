# Relational Model

The relational model is an approach to organizing and structuring data using tables, also referred to as "relations". It was first introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970 and has since become the foundation for most database management systems (DBMS), including PostgreSQL. This model organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a single record and each column represents an attribute or field of the record. 

The core concepts of the relational model include:

- **Attributes:** An attribute is a column within a table that represents a specific characteristic or property of an entity, such as "name", "age", "email", etc.

- **Tuples:** A tuple is a single row within a table that represents a specific instance of an entity with its corresponding attribute values.

- **Relations:** A relation is a table that consists of a set of tuples with the same attributes. It represents the relationship between entities and their attributes.

- **Primary Key:** A primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple within a table. It enforces the uniqueness of records and is used to establish relationships between tables.

- **Foreign Key:** A foreign key is an attribute within a table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to establish and enforce connections between relations.

- **Normalization:** Normalization is a process of organizing data in a way to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing complex tables into simpler tables, ensuring unique records, and properly defining foreign keys.

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** DML is a subset of SQL used to perform operations on data stored within the relational database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** DDL is another subset of SQL used to define, modify, or delete database structures, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

By understanding and implementing the relational model, databases can achieve high-level data integrity, reduce data redundancy, and simplify the process of querying and manipulating data. PostgreSQL, as an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System), fully supports the relational model, enabling users to efficiently and effectively manage their data in a well-structured and organized manner.
