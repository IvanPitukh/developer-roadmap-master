# Tell User What the Action is and Ask for it

In the world of UX design, one of the key objectives is to maintain effective communication with users and ensure that their needs and expectations are being met. One powerful technique to achieve this is through **Tell User and Ask** strategy.

## Tell User

This approach requires the designer to provide clear, concise, and relevant information to the user throughout their interaction with the product. This can be achieved through various means:

- **Visual cues**: Utilize colors, icons, and typography effectively to signal the user about important elements on the page or screen.
- **Microcopy**: Provide short, helpful pieces of text, such as labels or tooltips, to guide the user in taking appropriate actions.
- **Notifications**: Offer live updates, system status, and contextual feedback to keep the user informed about any ongoing processes or significant events.

## Ask User

Another important aspect of creating an engaging and interactive experience is through soliciting user input or feedback. This can facilitate two-way communication and ultimately contribute to a more personalized and efficient user experience. Some ways to incorporate this strategy into your design:

- **Forms and surveys**: Collect information from users in a structured and organized manner, using various input fields such as text, multiple-choice, and dropdowns.
- **Interactive elements**: Encourage users to engage with the interface, such as sliding for content, using progressive disclosure techniques, or utilizing drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Feedback mechanisms**: Provide quick and easy ways for users to express their opinions or report issues, such as clickable star ratings, feedback forms, or live chat features.

By combining the "Tell User" and "Ask User" strategies, UX designers can create a more dynamic and engaging user experience, while also staying in tune with the evolving needs and expectations of their audience.
