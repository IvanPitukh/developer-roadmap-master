# Tye

Tye (short for "Try Everything") is a developer tool for .NET that makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy microservices and distributed applications. It is built on top of the .NET Core CLI and Docker and provides a simple and consistent way to run multiple services and components locally, making it easy to test and debug distributed applications.

Tye allows you to define the components of your application in a single YAML file, and then automatically starts, stops and configures all the required services and dependencies. It also provides a set of features to make it easy to manage the application, such as automatic service discovery and configuration, and automatic binding of services to the right ports.
