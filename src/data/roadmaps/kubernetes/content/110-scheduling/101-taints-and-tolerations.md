# Taints and Tolerations

Taints and tolerations are used in Kubernetes to restrict or allow pods to be scheduled on certain nodes based on labels. A taint is a label that is applied to a node to indicate certain limitations or requirements. A toleration is a label applied to a pod to indicate that it can tolerate certain taints. When a node has a taint, only pods with the corresponding tolerations can be scheduled on that node. This feature is useful for various purposes, such as ensuring separation of critical and non-critical workloads, reserving nodes for certain tasks, and protecting nodes from overloading.
