# TCP vs UDP

TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees delivery of packets to the destination router. It includes error-checking and ensures packets are delivered in the correct order. On the other hand, UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a connectionless protocol which doesn't guarantee delivery or ensure correct sequencing of packets. As a result, UDP is considered faster and more efficient for some applications like video streaming or online gaming where speed matters more than accuracy. So, choosing between TCP and UDP really boils down to the specific requirements and priorities of the situation - it's a trade-off between speed and reliability.
