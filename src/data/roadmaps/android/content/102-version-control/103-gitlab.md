# GitLab

`Gitlab` is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool which provides a Git-repository manager, along with continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc. Users can manage and create their software projects and repositories, and collaborate on these projects with other members. `Gitlab` also allows users to view analytics and open issues of their project. It stands next to other version control tools like `GitHub` and `Bitbucket`, but comes with its own set of additional features and nuances. For Android development, `Gitlab` can be particularly useful owing to its continuous integration and deployment system which can automate large parts of the app testing and deployment.
