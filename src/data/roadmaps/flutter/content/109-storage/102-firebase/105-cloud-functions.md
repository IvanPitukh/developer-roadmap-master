# Firebase Cloud Functions

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless computing platform that simplifies backend development by allowing developers to write JavaScript or TypeScript code, which runs automatically in response to events from Firebase services or incoming HTTP requests. This framework leverages Google's cloud infrastructure to provide a scalable and managed environment, making it easier to build powerful serverless applications without the need for server maintenance.
