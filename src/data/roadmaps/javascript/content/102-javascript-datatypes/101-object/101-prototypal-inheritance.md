# Prototypal Inheritance

The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the Prototype of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf.
