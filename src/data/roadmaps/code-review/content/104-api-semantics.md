# Questions to Ask

- API as small as possible, as large as needed?
- Is there one way of doing one thing, not multiple ones?
- Is it consistent, does it follow the principle of least surprise?
- Clean split of API/internals without internals leaking into the API?
- Are there no breaking changes to user-facing parts (API classes, configuration, metrics, log formats, etc)?
- Is a new API generally useful and not overly specific to a single use case?
