# SafeAreaView

`SafeAreaView` is a React Native core component that helps to adjust your app's UI elements and layout to accommodate the notches, curved edges, or home indicator on iOS devices. It is particularly useful for the iPhone X and newer iPhone models, as it ensures that content is rendered within the visible portion of the screen.

Here is an example of using `SafeAreaView` in the code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example, the `SafeAreaView` component wraps around the content (in this case, a `Text` component), ensuring that the text is displayed within the safe area of the screen. By using `SafeAreaView`, you no longer have to worry about placing content outside the visible area or having it obstructed by the notch on iOS devices.

Keep in mind that `SafeAreaView` only works on iOS devices, and has no effect on Android devices. To handle such cases, you can use platform-specific styles or libraries like `react-native-safe-area-context` which provide more control and customization options for additional platforms.
