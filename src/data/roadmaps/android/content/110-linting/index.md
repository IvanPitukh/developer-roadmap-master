# Linting

`Linting` in Android is a tool that analyzes the source code of your application to identify potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term Linting came from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. In Android, it not only checks for potential Java issues but also for XML layout files and provides alerts for issues it encounters regarding usability, performance, and accessibility. For instance, it may scrutinize a draft of your AndroidManifest.xml file for potential duplication of elements or other anomalies that would cause the app to crash.
