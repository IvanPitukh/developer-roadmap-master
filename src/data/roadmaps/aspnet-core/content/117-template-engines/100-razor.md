# Razor

Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-side code in web pages. It was introduced with ASP.NET MVC 3 and later became a part of ASP.NET Web Pages. It allows developers to write server-side code using C# or Visual Basic and embed it in HTML markup. Its syntax is designed to be compact and easy to read. It provides a rich set of features for building web applications, such as a component model for building reusable UI, a routing system for navigation, and support for dependency injection, it also allows you to use the same libraries, frameworks, and tools that you're already familiar with from building traditional ASP.NET web applications.
