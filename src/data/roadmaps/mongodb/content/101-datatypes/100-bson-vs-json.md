# BSON vs JSON

In MongoDB, data is stored in a binary format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a superset of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). While both BSON and JSON are used to represent data in MongoDB, they have some key differences.

## BSON

BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It is designed to be efficient in storage, traversability, and encoding/decoding. Some of its key features include:

- **Binary Encoding**: BSON encodes data in a binary format, which offers better performance and allows the storage of data types not supported by JSON.
- **Support for Additional Data Types**: BSON supports more data types compared to JSON, such as `Date`, `Binary`, `ObjectId`, and `Decimal128`. This makes it possible to represent diverse data more accurately in MongoDB documents.
- **Efficient Traversability**: In BSON, the size of each element is encoded, which makes it easy to skip over elements, thus making the traversal faster.

## JSON

JSON is a lightweight and human-readable data representation format that can be easily parsed and generated by many programming languages. It is used widely as a medium for transmitting data over the web. Some features of JSON include:

- **Human-readable**: JSON is textual with a simple structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.
- **Interoperable**: JSON can be easily parsed and generated by many different programming languages, making it a popular choice for data interchange between applications.
- **Limited Data Types**: JSON supports fewer data types compared to BSON, such as strings, numbers, booleans, and `null`. This means that some data, like dates or binary data, must be represented as strings or custom objects in JSON.

## Summary

While BSON and JSON are related, they serve different purposes in the context of MongoDB:

- BSON is the binary format used by MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently with support for additional native data types.
- JSON, being a more human-readable and widely used format, is typically used for data interchange between MongoDB and applications.

By using BSON internally, MongoDB can take advantage of its benefits in storage, traversability, and a richer data type representation while still providing the interoperability and readability of JSON through query interfaces and drivers.
