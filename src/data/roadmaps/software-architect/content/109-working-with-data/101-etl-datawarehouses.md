# ETL Datawarehouses

In the world of data warehousing, if you need to bring data from multiple different data sources into one, centralized database, you must first:

- **EXTRACT** data from its original source
- **TRANSFORM** data by deduplicating it, combining it, and ensuring quality, to then
- **LOAD** data into the target database

ETL tools enable data integration strategies by allowing companies to gather data from multiple data sources and consolidate it into a single, centralized location. ETL tools also make it possible for different types of data to work together.
