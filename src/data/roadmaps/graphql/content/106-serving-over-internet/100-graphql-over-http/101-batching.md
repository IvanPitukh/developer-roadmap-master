# Batching

Batching in GraphQL refers to the process of sending multiple queries or mutations in a single request. This allows the client to reduce the number of round trips to the server, and can improve the performance of the application.

There are several ways to implement batching in GraphQL:

- Using a batching library: This approach involves using a library such as apollo-link-batch-http, which provides a way to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.
- Using a middleware: This approach involves using a middleware such as graphql-batch, which allows you to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.
- Using a serverless function: This approach involves using a serverless function such as AWS Lambda, which allows you to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.
