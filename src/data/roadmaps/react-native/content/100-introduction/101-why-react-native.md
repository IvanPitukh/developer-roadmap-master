# Why React Native?

React Native is a widely popular framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. There are plenty of reasons why you would want to choose React Native for your next mobile app development project:

- **Code Reusability:** React Native allows you to share a significant amount of your codebase between iOS and Android platforms. This not only reduces the development time but also makes it easier to maintain the app.
- **Familiar React Concepts:** If you're already familiar with ReactJS, React Native will feel right at home for you. Since it's based on React, the same principles of components and state management apply in React Native too.
- **Native Performance:** React Native apps deliver near-native performance as the framework works directly with native components like Views and Text, thus eliminating the need for WebView or other similar intermediaries.
- **Vast Ecosystem:** React Native enjoys a huge community and vast ecosystem that includes a wide range of libraries and tools that simplify and accelerate the development process. Additionally, Facebook and other major companies actively contribute to the growth and improvement of React Native.
- **Hot Reloading:** React Native supports hot-reloading, which means you can see the changes you make in your code directly on the device/emulator without having to recompile or rebuild the app entirely. This makes for a faster and more efficient development process.
