# RepoDB

RepoDB is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for .NET that simplifies the process of working with databases. It is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use library that provides a simple and consistent API for performing common database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

RepoDb is built on top of ADO.NET, which is the native data access technology in .NET, and provides a higher-level abstraction on top of it. This allows RepoDb to take advantage of the performance and scalability of ADO.NET while providing a simpler and more convenient API for developers.
