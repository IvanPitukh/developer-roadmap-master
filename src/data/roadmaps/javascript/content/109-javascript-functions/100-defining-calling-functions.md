# Defining and Calling Functions

**Defining:**

- JavaScript function _declarations_ are made by using the `function` keyword.
- Functions can also be defined by saving function _expressions_ to a variable. "Arrow" functions are commonly used in this way.

**Calling:**

- When a function is defined, it is not yet executed.
- To call and invoke a function's code, use the function's name followed by parentheses: `functionName()`.
