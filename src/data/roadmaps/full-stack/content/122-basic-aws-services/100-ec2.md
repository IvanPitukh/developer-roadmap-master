# EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the form of virtual servers, known as instances. With EC2, you can quickly scale your infrastructure up or down as your computing requirements change. This service effectively reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances, allowing you to easily adjust capacity according to the needs of your application.
