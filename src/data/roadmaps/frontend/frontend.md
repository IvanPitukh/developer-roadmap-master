  title: 'What is Frontend Development?'
  description: |
    Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and [JavaScript](/javascript), where HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour and interactivity.

    ## What does a Frontend Developer do?
    As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user interface of a website, to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design principles and user experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, and project managers to make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the best possible experience for the end-users.
