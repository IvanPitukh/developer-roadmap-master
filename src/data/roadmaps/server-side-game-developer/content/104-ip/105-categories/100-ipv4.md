# IPv4

`IPv4`, or Internet Protocol Version 4, is the fourth version of IP (Internet Protocol). It's a foundational protocol that routes most of the Internet traffic today, even with the growing reach of IPv6. `IPv4` is responsible for identifying devices on a network through an addressing system. The `IPv4` uses a 32-bit address schema allowing for a total of just over 4 billion addresses. Most importantly, `IPv4` determines how data is sent and received over network devices. This standard of `IPv4` helps to route data between networks and has been foundational in the creation of the modern Internet.
