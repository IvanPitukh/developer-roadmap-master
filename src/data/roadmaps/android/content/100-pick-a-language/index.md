# Pick a Language

When developing for Android, one crucial step is picking a programming language to use. There are multiple languages you can choose from, but the three most popular ones are Java, Kotlin, and C++. Java is the original language used for Android development and is widely used, making it a good choice for beginners due to the wealth of resources and developer communities. Kotlin is a newer option that is fully supported by Google and Android Studio, and addressing many of the drawbacks of Java which makes it a popular choice for many developers. Lastly, C++ can be used in Android development through the Android Native Development Kit (NDK), though it comes with more complexities and is usually not recommended for beginners. Your selection might depend on your existing familiarity with these languages, the complexity and specific requirements of your project, and the resources or libraries you wish to use.
