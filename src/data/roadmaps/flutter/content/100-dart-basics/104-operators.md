# Operators

Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values. There are several types of operators available in Flutter:

- Arithmetic operators: used to perform mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and more.
- Relational operators: used to compare values and return a boolean result (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
- Logical operators: used to perform logical operations like AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
- Assignment operators: used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=).
- Ternary operator: a shorthand way of writing simple if-else statements (condition ? if_true : if_false).

These operators can be used to perform operations on values, variables, and expressions in Flutter.
