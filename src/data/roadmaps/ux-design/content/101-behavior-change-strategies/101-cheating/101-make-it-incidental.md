# Make it Incidental

In UX design, making something incidental refers to subtly introducing a feature or element while the user is engaged in a different, primary task. The intention behind this approach is to avoid interrupting the user's flow, prevent them from feeling overwhelmed, and make the discovery of that feature feel more natural and serendipitous.

## Benefits of Making It Incidental

- **Less Overwhelming:** Users are not bombarded with too much information at once, as an incidental introduction happens when they are already engaged in another task.
- **Avoids Distractions:** It doesn't disrupt the flow of the application, allowing users to maintain focus on their original task.
- **Increases User Engagement:** As users chance upon a feature or element that they possibly need or find useful in the future, this may deepen their connection with the product.

## Techniques to Make it Incidental

- **Progressive disclosure:** Reveal information or features when relevant, in the context of the user's current task.
- **Guided interactions:** Introduce features while users are actively engaged in tasks, where the discovery is an organic part of the interaction.
- **Contextual hints:** Provide subtle cues or suggestions for users that signal the presence of additional features, which can be used when needed.

Remember, the key to making something incidental is to strategically place it within the user journey, so that it feels like a natural and seamless discovery. This approach can help create delightful and efficient user experiences.
