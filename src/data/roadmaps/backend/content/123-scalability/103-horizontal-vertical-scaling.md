# Horizontal/Vertical Scaling

Horizontal scaling is a change in the **number** of a resource. For example, increasing the number of virtual machines processing messages in a queue. Vertical scaling is a change in the **size/power** of a resource. For example, increasing the memory or disk space available to a machine. Scaling can be applied to databases, cloud resources, and other areas of computing.
