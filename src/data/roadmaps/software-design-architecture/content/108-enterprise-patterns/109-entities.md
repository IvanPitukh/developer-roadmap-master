# Entities

Entities are a pattern used in enterprise application development to represent the business concepts that have a unique identity and a lifetime. They are typically used to model real-world objects or concepts that have a distinct identity and a lifecycle, such as a customer, an order, or an account.

An Entity is defined by its identity, meaning that two entities with the same identity are considered to be the same, regardless of their state. Entities usually have a unique identifier, such as a primary key, that is used to identify them. They also have an associated set of properties or attributes that describe their state.
