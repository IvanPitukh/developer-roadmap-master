# Angular Velocity

Angular velocity, denoted by the symbol 'Ï‰', is a measure of the rate of change of an angle per unit of time. In simpler terms, it corresponds to how quickly an object moves around a circle or rotates around a central point. Angular velocity is typically measured in radians per second (rad/s). If you think of an object moving in a circular path, the angular velocity would be the speed at which the angle changes as the object travels along the circumference of the object. Angular velocity is a vector quantity, implying it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, following the right-hand rule. It plays a crucial role in game development, especially in physics simulation and character control.
