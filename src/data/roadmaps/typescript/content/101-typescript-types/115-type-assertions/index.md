# Type Assertions

Type assertions in TypeScript are a way to tell the compiler to treat a value as a specific type, regardless of its inferred type.

There are two syntaxes for type assertions in TypeScript:

- The "angle-bracket" syntax: `<T>value`
- The "as" syntax: value as `T`

For example:

```typescript
let num = 42;

// using angle-bracket syntax
let str = <string>num;

// using as syntax
let str2 = num as string;
```

In both examples, `num` is a number, but the type assertions tell the compiler to treat the value as a string.
