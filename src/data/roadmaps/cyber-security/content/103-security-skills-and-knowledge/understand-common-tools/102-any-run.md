[Any.Run](https://any.run/) is an interactive online malware analysis tool that helps researchers, analysts, and security enthusiasts investigate and understand potential malware, viruses, and other malicious files. This platform enables users to safely execute and observe file behavior in an isolated environment, known as a sandbox. By evaluating the behavior patterns of a suspicious file, Any.Run can help identify its potential threat to a user's system.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Online Sandbox:** Any.Run provides an online sandbox environment where users can securely upload and execute suspicious files for analysis without affecting their own computer systems.

- **Real-time Analysis:** As the file is executed in the sandbox, Any.Run provides real-time monitoring and visualization of processes, network activity, and file system changes. This aids in understanding the potential impact of a malicious file.

- **Integrated Threat Intelligence:** Any.Run automatically checks external threat intelligence sources like VirusTotal, which helps users see how the file has been classified by other antivirus solutions.

- **Multiple Operating Systems Support:** Users can select different operating systems and software configurations in the sandbox environment for more realistic and relevant analysis results.

- **Collaborative Analysis:** Any.Run allows users to share the results of their analysis with other researchers, fostering collaboration and threat intelligence sharing within the cybersecurity community.
