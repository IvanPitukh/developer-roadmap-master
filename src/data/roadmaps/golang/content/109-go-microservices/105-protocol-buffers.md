# Protocol buffers

Protocol Buffers(Protobuf) is a free, open-source, language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible data format used to serialize structured data. Itâ€™s like JSON, except it's smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings.

Some of the advantages of using protocol buffers include:

- Compact data storage
- Fast parsing
- Availability in many programming languages
- Optimized functionality through automatically-generated classes
