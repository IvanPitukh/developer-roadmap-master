# DNS

**Domain Name System (DNS)** is an internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. The internet uses IP addresses to locate and connect different computers, but these numerical addresses can be difficult to remember or use practically. Therefore, DNS allows users to type in a domain name, such as www.example.com, and it translates this name into the equivalent IP address, such as 192.0.2.1. It is used every time you visit a website, send an email, or connect to any service on the internet. DNS serves as the internet's phone book, ensuring that every domain name corresponds to the correct IP address.
