# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for decision-making. This technique utilizes multiple layers of algorithms (or neural networks) to process information. Deep learning involves training a model using large volumes of data and neural network architectures that contain many layers. A server-side game developer might use deep learning algorithms to create complex AI characters, improve game physics, or even analyze player data. Deep learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised and it's extensively applied in various domains such as voice recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, etc. It is a crucial element for many modern AI applications.
