# Features of C++ Compilers

Different C++ compilers have different features. Some of the most common features of C++ compilers are:

- **Optimization:** Compilers can optimize the code to improve the performance of the program. For example, they can remove redundant code, inline functions, and perform loop unrolling.
- **Debugging:** Compilers can generate debugging information that can be used to debug the program.
- **Warnings:** Compilers can generate warnings for suspicious code that may cause errors.

Some of the most popular C++ compilers are:

- **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):** GCC is a free and open-source compiler that supports many programming languages, including C++.
- **Clang:** Clang is a C++ compiler that is part of the LLVM project. It is designed to be compatible with GCC.
- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Microsoft Visual C++ is a C++ compiler that is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
- **Intel C++ Compiler:** Intel C++ Compiler is a C++ compiler that is part of the Intel Parallel Studio XE suite.

You should go through the documentation of your compiler to learn more about its features.
