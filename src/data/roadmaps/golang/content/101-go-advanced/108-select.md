# Select

The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.

A `select` blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready. The `select` statement is just like switch statement, but in the select statement, case statement refers to communication, i.e. sent or receive operation on the channel.
