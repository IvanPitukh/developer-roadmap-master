# Building Container Images

Container images are executable packages that include everything required to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. By building custom images, you can deploy applications seamlessly with all their dependencies on any Docker-supported platform.

## Dockerfile

The key component in building a container image is the `Dockerfile`. It is essentially a script containing instructions on how to assemble a Docker image. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image, making it easier to track changes and minimize the image size. Here's a simple example of a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Building an Image

Once you have created the Dockerfile, you can build the image using the `docker build` command. Execute the following command in the terminal from the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```sh
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`), and assign it a name (`-t your-image-name`).

## Inspecting Images and Layers

After a successful build, you can inspect the created image using `docker image` command:

```sh
docker image ls
```

To take a closer look at the individual layers of an image, use the `docker history` command:

```sh
docker history your-image-name
```

To view the layers of an image, you can also use the `docker inspect` command:

```sh
docker inspect your-image-name
```

To remove an image, use the `docker image rm` command:

```sh
docker image rm your-image-name
```


## Pushing Images to a Registry

Once your image is built, you can push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, etc.) to easily distribute and deploy your application. First, log in to the registry using your credentials:

```sh
docker login
```

Then, tag your image with the registry URL:

```sh
docker tag your-image-name username/repository:tag
```

Finally, push the tagged image to the registry:

```sh
docker push username/repository:tag
```

Building container images is a crucial aspect of using Docker, as it enables you to package and deploy your applications with ease. By creating a Dockerfile with precise instructions, you can effortlessly build and distribute images across various platforms.
