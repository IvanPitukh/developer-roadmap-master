# Class

In TypeScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. Here is an example of a simple class in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log(`Driving my ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }
}
```
