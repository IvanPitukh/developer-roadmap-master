# Rogue Access Point

A **Rogue Access Point (RAP)** is an unauthorized wireless access point that is installed or connected to a network without the network administrator's consent. These access points can be set up by attackers to exploit security vulnerabilities within the network or by employees for personal usage. RAPs can lead to several network-based attacks, causing severe damage to an organization's security.

## Risks Associated with Rogue Access Points

- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers can use RAPs to gain unauthorized access to a victim's sensitive data.

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Cybercriminals can intercept or alter the communication between two parties using RAPs, performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.

- **Information Theft**: By monitoring the traffic passing through a RAP, attackers can steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card information.

- **Network Vulnerabilities**: RAPs can create new security holes because they often bypass security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and VPNs.

## Detecting and Preventing Rogue Access Points

Here are some measures to help detect and prevent rogue access points:

- **Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS)**: WIDS helps identify and locate unauthorized access points, clients and ad-hoc connections in an organization's wireless network.

- **Regular Network Scans**: Perform regular network scans to detect any unauthorized devices connected to the network.

- **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Implement Network Access Control to restrict unauthorized devices from accessing the internal network.

- **Encryption and Authentication**: Apply strong encryption and authentication protocols such as WPA3, to reduce the chances of unauthorized devices connecting to the network.

- **User Awareness**: Educate employees about the risks associated with rogue access points and how to avoid unintentionally installing them.

By staying vigilant and implementing robust security measures, organizations can reduce the risks associated with rogue access points and protect their networks from potential cyberattacks.
