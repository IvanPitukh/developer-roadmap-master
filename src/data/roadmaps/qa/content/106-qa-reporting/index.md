# QA reporting

The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) glossary defines a QA report as: _Documentation summarizing test activities and results_.
By documenting the testing that was conducted and the results that were achieved, QA reports provide valuable insight into the health of the code base and critical metrics. As such, they should be generated on a regular basis to ensure the quality standards are being met.
So basically, test reports should document all of the test cases that were performed during software testing, as well as the results of those tests. They should also deliver relevant information about the product and highlight any areas where improvements can be made.
