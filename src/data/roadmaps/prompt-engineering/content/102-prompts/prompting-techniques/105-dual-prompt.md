# Dual Prompt Approach

**Dual Prompt** is a technique that combines two or more prompts to generate more specific and meaningful responses. This approach can be used to elicit more detailed information or to narrow down the focus of a response.

For example, let's say you are writing a guide about SEO. You could ask AI to write it for you with the following prompt:

```
Write me a guide about SEO.
```

However, this prompt may result in a generic guide without giving you what you may need.

By adopting dual prompt, you will receive a more specific response that is tailored to your needs. For the above example, we could write our prompt in two prompts as follows:

```
I am writing a guide about SEO. Give me 10 key topics that I should cover in this guide.
```

Now you can give it a second prompt:

```
Write me a detailed guide about each of the points you gave above.
```

Or you could also combine these prompts into a single prompt as follows:

```
I am writing a guide about SEO. Take the 10 key topics about SEO and write a detailed introduction to each.
```
