# Resources Usage

In this section, we will discuss how to configure PostgreSQL to control its resource usage. This includes managing memory, CPU usage, and I/O operations. Proper resource allocation is crucial for optimizing database performance and maintaining a high level of query execution efficiency.

## Memory Management

PostgreSQL can be configured to control its memory usage through the following parameters:

- **`shared_buffers`**: This parameter sets the amount of shared memory allocated for the shared buffer cache. It is used by all the database sessions to hold frequently-accessed database rows. Increasing `shared_buffers` may improve performance, but reserving too much memory may leave less room for other important system operations. The default value for this parameter is 32MB.

- **`work_mem`**: This parameter defines the amount of memory that can be used for internal sort operations and hash tables. Increasing `work_mem` may help speed up certain queries, but it can also lead to increased memory consumption if multiple queries are running concurrently. The default value is 4MB.

- **`maintenance_work_mem`**: This parameter sets the amount of memory used for maintenance-related tasks, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE. Increasing `maintenance_work_mem` can improve the performance of these operations. The default value is 64MB.

- **`effective_cache_size`**: This parameter sets an estimate of the working memory available for caching purposes. It helps the planner to find the optimal query plan based on the cache size. The default value is 4GB. It's recommended to set this value to the total available memory on the system minus the memory reserved for other tasks.

## CPU Utilization

PostgreSQL can control its CPU usage through the following parameters:

- **`max_parallel_workers_per_gather`**: This parameter defines the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a sequential scan or a join operation. Increasing this value can improve query performance in certain situations, but it might also lead to increased CPU usage. The default value is 2.

- **`effective_io_concurrency`**: This parameter sets the expected number of concurrent I/O operations that can be executed efficiently by the storage subsystem. Higher values might improve the performance of bitmap heap scans, but too high values can cause additional CPU overhead. The default value is 1.

## I/O Operations

PostgreSQL can control I/O operations through the following parameters:

- **`random_page_cost`**: This parameter sets the estimated cost of fetching a randomly accessed disk page. Lower values will make the planner more likely to choose an index scan over a sequential scan. The default value is 4.0.

- **`seq_page_cost`**: This parameter sets the estimated cost of fetching a disk page in a sequential scan. Lower values will make the planner more likely to choose sequential scans over index scans. The default value is 1.0.

By fine-tuning the above parameters, one can optimize PostgreSQL to make better use of the available resources and achieve enhanced performance. Be sure to test these changes and monitor their effects to find the most suitable configuration for your workload.
