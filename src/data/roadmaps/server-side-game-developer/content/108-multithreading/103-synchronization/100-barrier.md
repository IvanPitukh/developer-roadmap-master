# Barrier

`Barrier` in server-side game development refers to a type of synchronization method that can help manage multiple threads in a game's code. When a barrier point is set, all threads that reach this point are prevented from progressing until all the threads have reached this barrier. This functionality is a crucial aspect in synchronization to prevent inconsistencies and unsynchronized access to shared resources. It allows developers to ensure all processes are completed or all information is updated before moving on to the next step in the game's runtime. Barriers can be applied in various instances such as, but not limited to, game start-up, level completion, or during more complex inter-thread communications.
