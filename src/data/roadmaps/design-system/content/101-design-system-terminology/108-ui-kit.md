As it relates to a design system, a UI Kit is a representation of coded components created in a way that designers who donâ€™t know code can create interface mockups. Examples of UI kits are Sketch libraries and [Figma design systems](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-your-design-system-in-figma/).
