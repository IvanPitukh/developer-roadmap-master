# Protobuf

`Protobuf`, or Protocol Buffers, is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It's both language-neutral and platform-neutral. Google designed it to be smaller and faster than XML. You design your data structures in `.proto` files, then use the Protobuf compiler `protoc` to generate data access classes in your chosen language. Google provides support for several languages including: Java, C++, Python, Objective-C, and C#. Community developed support for even more languages is also available. This gives `protobuf` a great deal of versatility, making it a popular choice for data storage and communication between services.
