# False Negative / False Positive

In cybersecurity, one important aspect is the accuracy of security tools and systems in detecting threats and attacks. To capture this concept, we refer to four terms: _true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative_.

## True Positive (TP)

A true positive is an instance when security tools correctly detect and identify a threat, such as a malware or intrusion attempt. A high number of true positives indicates that a security tool is working effectively and catching potential threats as required.

## True Negative (TN)

A true negative occurs when the security tool correctly identifies that there is no threat or attack in a given situation. In other words, the system does not raise an alarm when there is no attack happening. A high number of true negatives show that the security tool is not overly sensitive, generating unnecessary alerts.

## False Positive (FP)

A false positive happens when the security tool mistakenly identifies a non-threat as a threat. For example, it might raise an alarm for a legitimate user's activity, indicating a potential attack when there isn't any. A high number of false positives can cause unnecessary diverting of resources and time, investigating false alarms. Additionally, it could lead to user frustration if legitimate activities are being blocked.

## False Negative (FN)

A false negative occurs when the security tool fails to detect an actual threat or attack. This could result in a real attack going unnoticed, causing damage to the system, data breaches, or other negative consequences. A high number of false negatives indicate that the security system needs to be improved to capture real threats effectively.

To have an effective cybersecurity system, security professionals aim to maximize true positives and true negatives, while minimizing false positives and false negatives. Balancing these aspects ensures that the security tools maintain their effectiveness without causing undue disruptions to a user's experience.

## Key Points

- **True Positive (TP)**: Correctly identifying a threat
- **True Negative (TN)**: Correctly identifying there is no threat
- **False Positive (FP)**: Mistakenly identifying a non-threat as a threat
- **False Negative (FN)**: Failing to detect a real threat

In summary, understanding false true negative positive concepts is crucial in developing and maintaining an effective cyber security system. By considering these metrics, security professionals can optimize their tools and processes to provide the best protection against cyber threats.
