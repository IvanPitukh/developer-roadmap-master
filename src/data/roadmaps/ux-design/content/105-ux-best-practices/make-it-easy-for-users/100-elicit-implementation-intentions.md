# Elicit Implementation Intentions

Eliciting implementation intentions is a powerful technique used in UX design to help users achieve their goals while using your platform or product. Implementation intentions are formed when users are encouraged to think about and plan specific actions they will take to reach a desired outcome. By incorporating prompts and guidance for users to make these plans, you can boost their chances of success and improve overall user satisfaction. In this section, we will discuss how to effectively elicit implementation intentions.

## Why Implementation Intentions Matter

Numerous studies show that when people form implementation intentions, they are more likely to follow through with their plans and achieve their goals. Instead of just having a vague idea of what they want to accomplish, users with implementation intentions have a clear roadmap of how and when to take action. This removes much of the guesswork and ambiguity that can hinder success and can make your UX design more effective at helping users achieve their desired outcomes.

## How to Elicit Implementation Intentions

To encourage users to form implementation intentions, you'll want to create prompts and guidance within your UX design that help them identify and plan for the specific actions they will take. Here are some tips to help you do this:

- **Break down goals into subtasks**: To help users make plans, divide their overarching goal into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Present these subtasks clearly within your design and encourage users to think about how and when they will complete them.

- **Provide clear instructions**: Offer step-by-step guidance to help users accomplish each subtask. This can take the form of tooltips, onboarding flows, or even simple checklists.

- **Set attainable deadlines**: Encourage users to set specific deadlines for when they will complete each subtask. Including a built-in calendar or scheduling functionality can help make this process more seamless.

- **Create reminders and notifications**: Incorporate reminder mechanisms into your design to help users stay on track with their plans. This can include push notifications, email reminders, or in-app alerts.

- **Track progress**: Make it easy for users to track their progress toward goal completion. Visual aids, such as progress bars and checklists, go a long way in helping users see how far they've come and encouraging them to keep going.

- **Offer encouragement and feedback**: Positive reinforcement can help keep users motivated and engaged with their plans. Congratulate users on milestones reached and provide feedback on their progress.

By incorporating these strategies into your UX design, you can foster an environment that supports users in forming implementation intentions and helps them achieve their goals more effectively. Remember, the easier it is for users to make plans and take actionable steps towards their objectives, the more successful and satisfied they will be with your product.
