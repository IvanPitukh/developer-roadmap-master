# Structured Programming

Structured programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of structured control flow constructs, such as loops and conditional statements, to organize code into logical, easy-to-understand blocks. It is a way of writing computer programs that emphasizes the use of procedures and functions, as well as data structures, to organize code and make it easier to understand, debug, and maintain. The main idea behind structured programming is to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces that can be easily understood, tested, and modified. This approach is opposed to the use of "goto" statements, which are considered to be unstructured and can lead to difficult-to-read and difficult-to-maintain code.
