# WPS

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature available in many Wi-Fi routers and access points that is designed to simplify the process of connecting devices to a wireless network. With WPS, users can easily connect to a secure Wi-Fi network without the need for manually entering the network's password.

There are multiple methods for using WPS, some of which include:

- **Push-button method**: This is the most common method of using WPS. The user simply pushes the WPS button on the router, and then on the device they want to connect within a certain time period. This automatically establishes a secure connection between the device and the router.
- **PIN method**: In this method, a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) is generated by the router or access point, which the user must then enter on the device they wish to connect.
- **NFC method**: Some devices come with near-field communication (NFC) capabilities, allowing users to establish a secure connection by simply tapping their device against the router or access point.

Though WPS can provide ease of use and quick connectivity, it has some security concerns. The main concern arises from the PIN method, as the 8-digit PINs are susceptible to brute force attacks. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a network. As a result, many cyber security experts recommend disabling WPS or using the push-button method only.

In conclusion, while WPS can make connecting devices to a wireless network more convenient, its associated security risks make it essential for users to be aware of best practices to protect their networks.
