# Decision Learning

In the realm of game development, **Decision Learning**  refers to information systems that recognize and analyze patterns to help in making decisions. Itâ€™s particularly used in AI game development where decision-making algorithms or artificial intelligence are programmed to learn from and make decisions based on past experiences or an established decision tree. These decisions can be about game behaviors, player interactions, environment changes and so on. Various methods such as reinforcement learning, Bayesian methods, Decision trees, Neural networks are used to facilitate decision learning in game development.
