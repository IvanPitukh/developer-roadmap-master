# MVC

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a widely used design pattern for designing software's architecture. According to this, an application is divided into three core components. The 'Model' is responsible for handling the data and business logic. The 'View' is responsible for rendering the model's data and generating the user interface. The 'Controller' acts as an interface between the Model and View. It processes all the user's interactions and updates the View and Model accordingly. It's crucial to note that in MVC, the View can have multiple representations of the Model.
