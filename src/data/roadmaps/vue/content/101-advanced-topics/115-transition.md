# Transition

Vue offers two built-in components that can help work with transitions and animations in response to changing state:

- `<Transition>` for applying animations when an element or component is entering and leaving the DOM. This is covered on this page.
- `<TransitionGroup>` for applying animations when an element or component is inserted into, removed from, or moved within a `v-for` list. This is covered in the next chapter.
