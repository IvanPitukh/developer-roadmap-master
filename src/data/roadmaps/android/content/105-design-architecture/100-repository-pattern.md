# Repository Pattern

In Android design architecture, the `Repository Pattern` separates the data sources from the rest of the application. It acts as a mediator between different data sources, such as persistent models, web services, or caches. Instead of having the network and database calls spread out throughout your ViewModel, they are encapsulated within a Repository class. This separation will make the code clean, easy to read and testable. It provides a simple API for data access, the rest of the app doesn't need to know where the data is coming from it just asks the repository.
