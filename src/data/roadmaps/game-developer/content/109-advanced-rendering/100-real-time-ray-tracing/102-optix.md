# OptiX

`OptiX` is an application framework developed by NVIDIA for achieving high performance ray tracing in graphics processing unit (GPU) programming. It's mainly intended for use in real-time graphics application, scientific simulations, and other visual computing applications. `OptiX` provides key functionalities such as hierarchical object acceleration, programmable ray generation, material shading, and dynamic scene management to achieve fast and state-of-the-art rendering. This highly efficient, scalable and flexible API supports the coding of applications, not just for graphic rendering but also for collision detection and physics simulation. Please note that access to `OptiX` currently requires NVIDIA GeForce, Quadro and Tesla products with Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Volta, Turing and later generation GPUs.
