# WPA vs WPA2 vs WPA3 vs WEP

In this section, we will discuss the differences between various wireless security protocols: WPA, WPA2, WPA3, and WEP.

## WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

WEP was the first wireless security protocol, introduced in 1999, with the goal of providing a level of privacy and security similar to that of wired networks. However, WEP has major security flaws and can be easily compromised. It uses a weak encryption algorithm (RC4) and static encryption keys that can be easily cracked with readily available tools.

## WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

WPA was introduced in 2003 as a temporary solution to address the security shortcomings of WEP. It improved security by implementing Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption and using dynamic encryption keys that change with each data packet transmitted. WPA also incorporated a pre-shared key (PSK) authentication method. However, WPA still uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, which has known vulnerabilities.

## WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

WPA2, released in 2004, is an upgraded version of WPA and is now the most widely used wireless security standard. It replaced the RC4 encryption algorithm with the much more secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). WPA2 offers two authentication methods: WPA2-Personal (using a pre-shared key (PSK)) and WPA2-Enterprise (using the 802.1X authentication framework). WPA2 provides a significant improvement in security over WPA, but it is still vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the KRACK attack.

## WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)

WPA3 is the latest and most secure wireless security protocol, launched in 2018. It offers several major improvements over WPA2, including:

- Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE): A more secure password-based authentication method that protects against dictionary and brute-force attacks.
- 192-bit security suite: An enhanced level of encryption for enterprise and government networks requiring higher security levels.
- Enhanced Open: Improved security for open Wi-Fi networks by encrypting data transmission without requiring a shared password.
- Easy Connect: Streamlined configuration for IoT devices with limited or no display interface.

In summary, WPA3 addresses many of the security vulnerabilities found in WPA2 and provides a higher level of security for wireless networks. However, as it is relatively new, not all devices currently support WPA3.
