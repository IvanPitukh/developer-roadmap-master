# Clipping

`Clipping` is a fundamental technique in computer graphics primarily used for efficiently rendering a three-dimensional scene. This process involves eliminating certain parts of objects in the scene that are out-of-view or obstructed by other objects. Clipping can occur in various ways, one of the most common methods being `View-frustum culling` where objects completely outside of the camera view are discarded. The aim of clipping is to optimize the graphic rendering pipeline by reducing the number of polygons that the graphic hardware needs to process. Consequently, this helps in improving the speed and overall performance of the rendering process.
