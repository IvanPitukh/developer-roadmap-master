## Monitoring with temBoard

In this section, we'll explore a powerful management and monitoring tool for PostgreSQL: `temBoard`. It's a user-friendly, highly adaptable, and open-source web application designed to monitor and manage your database instances efficiently.

### What is temBoard?

`temBoard` is a comprehensive management and monitoring solution for PostgreSQL instances. It provides a real-time, detail-oriented view of databases and their current status allowing administrators to oversee their system efficiently. Key features of temBoard include:

- Real-time monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Historical data analysis with a built-in data retention mechanism.
- An intuitive and customizable web interface.
- High-level security with role-based access control and SSL/TLS support.
- Management of multiple PostgreSQL clusters from one central location.
- Extensibility through plugins for specific tasks.

### Installing temBoard

You can install temBoard using `pip`, Python's standard package manager. Before installation, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.6 or higher: You can install Python from the official website or through your package manager.
2. PostgreSQL server 9.4 or higher: Your PostgreSQL instance should be compatible with temBoard for full feature support.

Use the following command to install temBoard using `pip`:

```
pip install temboard
```

### Configuring and Running temBoard

After installation, temBoard needs to be configured properly to start monitoring the PostgreSQL database. Follow these steps to configure temBoard:

1. Create the temBoard configuration file: The default location is `/etc/temboard/temboard.conf`. You can use the following command to create and edit the file:

    ```
    sudo mkdir /etc/temboard
    sudo touch /etc/temboard/temboard.conf
    sudo nano /etc/temboard/temboard.conf
    ```

2. Add the following contents to the configuration file and modify the values as needed:

    ```
    [temboard]
    address = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8888
    ssl_cert_file = /etc/temboard/temboard_SERVER_NAME_chained.pem
    ssl_key_file = /etc/temboard/temboard_SERVER_NAME.key
    [repository]
    host = localhost
    port = 5432
    user = temboard
    password = temboard_password
    dbname = temboard
    [logging]
    method = stderr
    level = INFO
    format = %(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s
    ```

3. Initialize the temBoard repository: Use the following command to initialize the database for temBoard:

    ```
    temboard-admin -c /etc/temboard/temboard.conf initialize
    ```

4. Start temBoard as a service: You can start temBoard using the following command:

    ```
    temboard -c /etc/temboard/temboard.conf
    ```

After running temBoard, access the web interface using your browser at `https://<your_server_name>:8888/`. You can now monitor and manage your PostgreSQL instances using the temBoard web interface.
