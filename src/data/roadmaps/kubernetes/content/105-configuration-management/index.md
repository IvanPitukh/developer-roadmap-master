# Configuration Management

Configuration management in Kubernetes (K8s) is the process of defining and managing the configuration of your applications running in a K8s cluster. K8s provides several mechanisms for managing configuration, including ConfigMaps and Secrets, and supports several ways to inject configuration into your application's containers. Configuration management is tightly integrated with other Kubernetes features and is critical for building scalable and reliable applications in Kubernetes.
