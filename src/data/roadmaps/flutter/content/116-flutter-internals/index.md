# Flutter Internals

The internal workings of Flutter refer to the underlying mechanisms and architecture that make up the Flutter framework.

At a high level, Flutter is a reactive framework for building user interfaces, which means that it allows developers to build dynamic, responsive apps that update automatically in response to changes in the state of the app.

Flutter achieves this by using a unique rendering engine that is based on the Skia graphics library. The rendering engine allows Flutter to render complex animations and graphics with high performance, and it also provides a way for Flutter to manage the layout and size of widgets in the app.
