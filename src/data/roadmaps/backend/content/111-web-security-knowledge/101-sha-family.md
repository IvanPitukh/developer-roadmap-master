# SHA family

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) is a family of cryptographic hash functions created by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The family includes:

- SHA-0: Published in 1993, this is the first algorithm in the family. Shortly after its release, it was discontinued for an undisclosed significant flaw.
- SHA-1: Created to replace SHA-0 and which resembles MD5, this algorithm has been considered insecure since 2010.
- SHA-2: This isn't an algorithm, but a set of them, with SHA-256 and SHA-512 being the most popular. SHA-2 is still secure and widely used.
- SHA-3: Born in a competition, this is the newest member of the family. SHA-3 is very secure and doesn't carry the same design flaws as its brethren.
