# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to common problems in software development that can be used to improve the quality and maintainability of your code. Here are some popular design patterns that are commonly used in Flutter development:

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- Provider Pattern
- Bloc Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Composite Pattern

When choosing a design pattern for your Flutter application, consider your specific requirements and use cases. You may also want to consider the trade-offs between different patterns, such as maintainability, scalability, and ease of use.
