# Test Cases and Scenarios

A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, and postcondition developed for a specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.

A Test Scenario is defined as any functionality that can be tested. It is a collective set of test cases which helps the testing team to determine the positive and negative characteristics of the project.
