# Authentication Models

PostgreSQL offers various authentication models to ensure the security and proper management of user access. These models manage the interaction between PostgreSQL clients and the server. Here, we discuss the most common authentication methods available in PostgreSQL.

## Trust Authentication

In trust authentication, the PostgreSQL server trusts any connection attempt from specified hosts, without requiring a password. Although it is simple to configure, it could pose security risks, especially when used for remote connections. This method is only recommended for local development and testing environments.

```
# Sample trust authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
local   all             all                                     trust
```

## Password Authentication

There are three different password-based authentication models in PostgreSQL:

- `Password`: This method sends the password in clear-text format. It is vulnerable to eavesdropping and is not recommended for securing your database.

- `md5`: Passwords are encrypted using the MD5 hashing algorithm. This method offers better security, as only the hash is transmitted over the network.

- `scram-sha-256`: It is the most secure password-based authentication method provided by PostgreSQL. It uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 hashing algorithm and offers features like salting and iteration count to further enhance security.

```
# Sample password authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
```

## Peer and Ident Authentication

Both `peer` and `ident` methods map the operating system user to a PostgreSQL user with the same name. The `peer` method is used for local connections, while `ident` is used for TCP/IP connections.

```
# Sample peer authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
local   all             all                                     peer

# Sample ident authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               ident map=my_ident_map
```

## Certificate-based Authentication (SSL)

This method uses SSL/TLS certificates to establish a secure connection between the client and the server. It enhances security by verifying client certificates against a Certificate Authority (CA).

```
# Sample SSL authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               cert clientcert=1
```

## LDAP Authentication

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is commonly used for managing users and groups in an organization. PostgreSQL can authenticate users against an LDAP server. The LDAP server is responsible for verifying the PostgreSQL user's credentials.

```
# Sample LDAP authentication configuration in "pg_hba.conf"
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               ldap ldapserver=ldap.example.com ldapprefix="uid=" ldapsuffix=",ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
```

In conclusion, PostgreSQL provides various authentication models to suit different requirements. It is important to choose an appropriate method according to the security needs of your environment.
