# Authorization

Authorization in GraphQL refers to the process of controlling access to specific fields, types, or operations in a GraphQL schema based on user roles or permissions. It allows you to restrict access to certain data or functionality in your application based on the user's role or permissions.

There are several ways to implement authorization in GraphQL:

- Using middleware
- Using schema directives
- Using a data source layer
