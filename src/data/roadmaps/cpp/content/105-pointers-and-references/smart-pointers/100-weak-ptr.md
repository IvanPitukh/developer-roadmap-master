# Weak Pointer

A `weak_ptr` is a type of smart pointer in C++ that adds a level of indirection and safety to a raw pointer. It is mainly used to break reference cycles in cases where two objects have shared pointers to each other, or when you need a non-owning reference to an object that is managed by a `shared_ptr`.

A `weak_ptr` doesn't increase the reference count of the object it points to, which is a crucial distinction between `weak_ptr` and `shared_ptr`. This ensures that the object will be deleted once the last `shared_ptr` that owns it goes out of scope, even if there are `weak_ptr`s still referencing it.

To use a `weak_ptr`, you must convert it to a `shared_ptr` using the `lock()` function, which tries to create a new `shared_ptr` that shares ownership of the object. If successful, the object's reference count is increased and you can use the returned `shared_ptr` to safely access the object.

Here's an example of using `weak_ptr`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class MyClass {
public:
    void DoSomething() {
        std::cout << "Doing something...\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    std::weak_ptr<MyClass> weak;

    {
        std::shared_ptr<MyClass> shared = std::make_shared<MyClass>();
        weak = shared;

        if(auto sharedFromWeak = weak.lock()) {
            sharedFromWeak->DoSomething(); // Safely use the object
            std::cout << "Shared uses count: " << sharedFromWeak.use_count() << '\n'; // 2
        }
    }

    // shared goes out of scope and the MyClass object is destroyed

    if(auto sharedFromWeak = weak.lock()) {
        // This block will not be executed because the object is destroyed
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Object has been destroyed\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a `shared_ptr` named `shared` that manages a `MyClass` object. By assigning it to a `weak_ptr` named `weak`, we store a non-owning reference to the object. Inside the inner scope, we create a new `shared_ptr` named `sharedFromWeak` using `weak.lock()` to safely use the object. After the inner scope, the `MyClass` object is destroyed since `shared` goes out of scope, and any further attempt to create a `shared_ptr` from `weak` will fail as the object is already destroyed.
