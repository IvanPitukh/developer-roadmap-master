# Unions

Unions are useful in cases where a field can return multiple types and you want to handle those types differently in your client. They also allow for more flexibility in how you structure your schema, as you can group types together that share common fields.

Unions don't allow to specify a common set of fields to be queried across multiple types, but it allows to handle multiple types differently in your client.
