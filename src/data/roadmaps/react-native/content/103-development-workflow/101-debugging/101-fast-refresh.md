# Enabling Fast Refresh

Fast Refresh is a React Native feature that allows you to get near-instant feedback while making changes in your code. It achieves this by reloading only the portion of the app that was changed, without losing the current state. This makes the development process a lot smoother as you don't have to wait for the entire app to rebuild after making a change.

Learn more about Fast Refresh and how to enable it in the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).
