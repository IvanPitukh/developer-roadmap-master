# Use Meaningful Names

Using meaningful names is important for making the code clear, readable, and easy to understand. Meaningful names can help to convey the intent and function of variables, functions, classes, and other elements of the code.

Here are some ways to use meaningful names in system architecture:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and other elements of the code.
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase, such as camelCase for variables and PascalCase for functions and classes.
- Use abbreviations and acronyms sparingly and only if they are widely understood.
- Use meaningful prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type or purpose of a variable or function, such as "is" or "get" for boolean variables or "list" for array variables
- Avoid using single letter variable names or generic names, such as "temp" or "x" that do not convey any meaning.
- Avoid using overly long or complex names that make the code harder to read.
