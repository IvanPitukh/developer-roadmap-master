# Storage

React Native provides a few ways to persist data locally in the app. Here's a brief summary of the storage options available:

- Async Storage
- Expo Secure Store
- Expo File System
- Expo SQLite

Choose the storage option that best fits your app's requirements and use cases. Keep in mind that AsyncStorage and SecureStorage are more suited for small-scale data storage, while Realm and SQLite support more complex storage and querying needs.
