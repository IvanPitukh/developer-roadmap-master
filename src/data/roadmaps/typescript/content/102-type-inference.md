# Type Inference

Type inference in TypeScript refers to the process of automatically determining the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. This allows you to write code that is more concise and easier to understand, as the TypeScript compiler can deduce the types of variables without you having to explicitly specify them.

Here's an example of type inference in TypeScript:

```typescript
let name = 'John Doe';
```

In this example, the TypeScript compiler automatically infers that the type of the name variable is string. This means that you can use the name variable just like any other string in your code, and the TypeScript compiler will ensure that you don't perform any invalid operations on it.
