# MassTransit

MassTransit is an open-source, highly configurable service bus framework for building distributed systems using the .NET framework. It allows developers to easily create message-based, loosely-coupled applications by providing a simple and fluent API for defining message contracts, handling messages, and managing message routing.

It supports multiple messaging transports such as RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS and others, automatic serialization and deserialization of messages, automatic retries and exception handling for failed message deliveries, and support for advanced messaging patterns like publish-subscribe, request-response, and event-driven architectures.
