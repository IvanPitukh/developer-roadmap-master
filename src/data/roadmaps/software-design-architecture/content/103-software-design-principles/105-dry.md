# DRY

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a software development principle that suggests that code should not have duplicate functionality. The idea is to keep the codebase as simple as possible by eliminating redundancy and duplication. The goal is to reduce complexity and improve maintainability by ensuring that each piece of knowledge is expressed in a single, unambiguous way within the system.

The DRY principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which are part of the SOLID principles. The DRY principle aims to reduce the amount of duplicate code by creating abstractions that can be reused across the system.
