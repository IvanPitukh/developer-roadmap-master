# Multithreading

`Multithreading 2` in game development usually refers to an advanced level of understanding, managing, and implementing multithreaded programming. At this stage, developers are expected to manage inter-thread communications and synchronization effectively. This includes mastering the use of mutexes, locks, semaphores, and condition variables. This level extends to the fine-tuning of performance and resolving complex issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation. Furthermore, it could cover advanced topics like thread-pools and executing modern multithreaded game architectures efficiently and safely. In multithreading 2, developers learn to leverage more concurrent computing power, thus making the server more performant and responsive.
