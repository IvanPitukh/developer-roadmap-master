# Coroutines

In Android, `coroutines` refer to a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. `Coroutines` provide a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a natural, sequential manner. The fundamental building blocks of `coroutines` are `suspend` functions which are simply functions that can be paused and resumed at later times. They are the key to writing non-blocking asynchronous code and represent a single unit of asynchronous computation. This aspect of `coroutines` makes them useful for managing long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your application to become unresponsive.
