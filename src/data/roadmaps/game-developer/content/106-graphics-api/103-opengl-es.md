# OpenGL ES

OpenGL ES (Open Graphics Library for Embedded Systems) is a simplified version of OpenGL, designed for use on systems with lower computational power, such as mobile devices and embedded systems. Despite its semantic simplifications, OpenGL ES still retains high versatility and capability, allowing for high-performance 2D and 3D graphics on these smaller, less powerful systems. OpenGL ES has become particularly popular in mobile game development, with major platforms like Android and iOS providing full support for it. The API is divided into several versions, the latest of which, OpenGL ES 3.2, was released in 2016.
