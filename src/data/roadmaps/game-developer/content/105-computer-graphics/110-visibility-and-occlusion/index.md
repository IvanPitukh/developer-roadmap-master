# Visibility and Occlusion

"Visibility and occlusion" in computer graphics refers to the process of determining which parts of a particular object are visible from a certain viewpoint and which are hidden. "Occlusion" describes the phenomenon where an object is blocked from view by another object. Understanding these concepts is important for creating realistic renderings in game design. Real-time engines typically use data structures like BSP-trees, Quad-trees or Octrees to quickly identify occlusion. Advanced techniques such as Occlusion culling and Z-buffering are used to further optimize the representation of visible and hidden parts of 3D objects. Understanding the depths and dimensions related to visibility and occlusion empowers the game developer to enhance presentation and performance.
