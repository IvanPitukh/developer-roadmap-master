# Doctest

Pythonâ€™s standard library comes equipped with a test framework module called doctest. The doctest module programmatically searches Python code for pieces of text within comments that look like interactive Python sessions. Then, the module executes those sessions to confirm that the code referenced by a doctest runs as expected.
