# Code by Actor

"Code by Actor" is a software development technique that encourages developers to organize their code around the actors or entities that interact with it. Actors can be users, systems, or processes that perform a specific role or function within the application. This approach helps to create a clear separation of concerns, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.
