# Filtering Data in PostgreSQL

Filtering data is an essential feature in any database management system, and PostgreSQL is no exception. When we refer to filtering data, we're talking about selecting a particular subset of data that fulfills specific criteria or conditions. In PostgreSQL, we use the **WHERE** clause to filter data in a query based on specific conditions.

## The WHERE Clause
The **WHERE** clause is used to filter records from a specific table. This clause is used along with the **SELECT**, **UPDATE**, or **DELETE** statements to get the desired output.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Example
Consider the following `employees` table:
| id | name | department | position | salary |
|----|------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1  | John | HR         | Manager  | 5000   |
| 2  | Jane | IT         | Developer| 4500   |
| 3  | Mark | Marketing  | Designer | 4000   |

To select all records from the `employees` table where `salary` is greater than 4000:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 4000;
```

## Comparison Operators

PostgreSQL supports various comparison operators with the WHERE clause:

- **Equal to:** `=`
- **Not equal to:** `<>` or `!=`
- **Greater than:** `>`
- **Less than:** `<`
- **Greater than or equal to:** `>=`
- **Less than or equal to:** `<=`

These operators can be used to filter data based on numerical, string, or date comparisons.

## Combining Multiple Conditions

To filter data using multiple conditions, PostgreSQL provides the following logical operators:

- **AND**: This operator is used when you want both conditions to be true.
- **OR**: This operator is used when you want either condition to be true.

## Syntax
- **AND:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```

- **OR:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

## Example
Using the previous `employees` table, to select records where the department is 'IT' and the salary is greater than or equal to 4500:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary >= 4500;
```

And to select records where either the position is 'Manager' or the salary is less than or equal to 4000:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE position = 'Manager' OR salary <= 4000;
```

In summary, filtering data in PostgreSQL is achieved using the WHERE clause along with various comparison and logical operators. This powerful feature allows you to retrieve, update, or delete records that meet specific criteria.
