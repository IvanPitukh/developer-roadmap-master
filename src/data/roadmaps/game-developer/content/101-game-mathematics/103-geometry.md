# Geometry

Geometry in game development refers to the mathematical study used to define the spatial elements within a game. This is vital in determining how objects interact within a game's environment. Particularly, geometry is employed in various aspects like object rendering, collision detection, character movement, and the calculation of angles and distance. It allows developers to create the spatial parameters for a game, including object dimensions and orientations. Understanding the basics such as 2D vs 3D, polygons, vertices, meshes and more advanced topics such as vectors, matrices, quaternions etc. is crucial to this field.
