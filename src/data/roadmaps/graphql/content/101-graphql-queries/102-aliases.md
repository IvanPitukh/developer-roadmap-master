# Aliases

Aliases in GraphQL are a way to rename fields when they are requested in a query. They are useful in situations where a field is requested multiple times, but with different arguments, or when the field has a name that is not suitable for the client's usage. They make it easy to distinguish and work with fields in the response and make the query more readable.
