# Jetpack Benchmark

Jetpack Benchmark is a library within the Android Jetpack Suite that allows developers to quickly and accurately measure the performance of their apps. This library can help measure CPU, memory, and IO performance of code in Android apps. Developers can define some specific code paths to be benchmarked by wrapping the code in `BenchmarkRule.measureRepeated {}`. In addition, it automatically takes care of warmup, measures your code performance, and outputs benchmarking results to the Android Studio's logcat.
