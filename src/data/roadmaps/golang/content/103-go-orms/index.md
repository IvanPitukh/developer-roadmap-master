# ORMs

Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database", hence a layer of abstraction, that can be used from within the programming language.

Most common ORM library in Go is [GORM](https://gorm.io/).
