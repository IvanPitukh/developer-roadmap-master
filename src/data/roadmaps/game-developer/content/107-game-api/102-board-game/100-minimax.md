# Minimax

`Minimax` is an artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making algorithm mainly used in decision making and game theory, particularly for two player zero-sum games. It formulates a strategy by simulating all possible game scenarios and assuming that the opponent is playing an optimal game. Minimax operates by the player minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario and thus making the 'maximum of the minimum' possible scenarios. This algorithm is often combined with `alpha-beta pruning` technique to increase its efficiency.
