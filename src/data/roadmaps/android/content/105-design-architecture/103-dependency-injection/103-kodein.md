# Kodein

`Kodein` is one of the recommended dependency injection frameworks suitable for Android development. This open-source Kotlin library simplifies the DI process by allowing developers to bind various types of dependencies, such as singleton, factory, or provider bindings into containers or `Kodein` modules. It promotes dependency declaration where used, instead of prior declaration. It follows a "Define in Use" principle that enables easy-to-use, easy-to-debug and very idiomatic Kotlin code. It's also worth noting that `Kodein` works hand in hand with Android's lifecycle and provides easy integration with popular libraries such as Android Architecture Components, leveraging their functionality.
