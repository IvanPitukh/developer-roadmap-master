# Load Balancing

Load balancing in distributes network traffic across multiple pods or nodes using a Service object. A Service provides a stable network endpoint for a set of pods, allowing other pods or external clients to access them through a single IP address and DNS name. Kubernetes offers three types of load balancing algorithms for Services, which distribute traffic based on round-robin, least connections, or IP hash. Load balancing is an essential part of Kubernetes networking, providing efficient and reliable traffic distribution across a cluster.
