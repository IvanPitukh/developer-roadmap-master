# Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to create, manage, and run your applications using a simple YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`. This file describes your application's services, networks, and volumes, allowing you to easily run and manage your containers using just a single command.

Some of the benefits of using Docker Compose include:

- **Simplified Container Management:** Docker Compose allows you to define and configure all your services, networks, and volumes in one place, making it easy to manage and maintain.

- **Reproducible Builds:** Share your `docker-compose.yml` file with others to make sure they have the same environment and services running as you do.

- **Versioning Support:** Docker Compose files can be versioned for easier compatibility across different versions of the Docker Compose tool itself.

## Creating a Docker Compose File:

To create a `docker-compose.yml` file, start by specifying the version of Docker Compose you want to use, followed by the services you want to define. Here's an example of a basic `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
```

In this example, we have specified two services: a web server (`web`) running the latest version of the nginx image, and a database server (`db`) running MySQL. The web server exposes its port 80 to the host machine, and the database server has an environment variable set for the root password.

## Running Docker Compose:

To run your Docker Compose application, simply navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose will read the file and start the defined services in the specified order.

## Other Useful Commands:

- `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes all running containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker-compose ps`: Lists the status of all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker-compose logs`: Displays the logs of all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker-compose build`: Builds all images defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
