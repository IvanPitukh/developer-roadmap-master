# C / C++

"C" and "C++", often written as "C/CPP", are two significantly prominent and similar programming languages widely used in server-side game development. "C" is a procedural language, which means that it follows a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem, while "C++" is both a procedural and object-oriented programming (OOP) language. This dual nature of "C++" allows it to handle more complex interrelated data and functions efficiently, which is a beneficial feature in game development. Moreover, "C++" is an extension of "C", meaning that any legal "C" program is also a valid "C++" program. Both languages offer a high degree of control over system resources and memory, making them an excellent choice for building fast and efficient server-side applications, such as multiplayer game servers.
