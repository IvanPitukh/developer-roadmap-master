# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, statelessness, and the use of functions to transform data. Dart, being a modern programming language, supports functional programming concepts such as:

- Higher-Order Functions: Dart supports functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output.
- Immutable Data: Dart provides support for immutable data structures and encourages the use of these data structures in functional programming.
- Lambdas/Closures: Dart has support for anonymous functions, also known as lambdas or closures, which can be used to create simple and concise functions.
- Pure Functions: Dart encourages the use of pure functions, which are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output given the same inputs.
