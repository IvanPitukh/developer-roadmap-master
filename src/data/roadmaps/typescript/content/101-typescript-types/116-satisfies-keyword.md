# satisfies Keyword

TypeScript developers are often faced with a dilemma: we want to ensure that some expression matches some type, but also want to keep the most specific type of that expression for inference purposes.

For example:

```typescript
// Each property can be a string or an RGB tuple.
const palette = {
  red: [255, 0, 0],
  green: '#00ff00',
  bleu: [0, 0, 255],
  //  ^^^^ sacrebleu - we've made a typo!
};

// We want to be able to use array methods on 'red'...
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);

// or string methods on 'green'...
const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```

Notice that we’ve written `bleu`, whereas we probably should have written `blue`. We could try to catch that `bleu` typo by using a type annotation on palette, but we’d lose the information about each property.

```typescript
type Colors = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue';
type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];

const palette: Record<Colors, string | RGB> = {
  red: [255, 0, 0],
  green: '#00ff00',
  bleu: [0, 0, 255],
  //  ~~~~ The typo is now correctly detected
};
// But we now have an undesirable error here - 'palette.red' "could" be a string.
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);
```

The `satisfies` operator lets us validate that the type of an expression matches some type, without changing the resulting type of that expression. As an example, we could use `satisfies` to validate that all the properties of palette are compatible with `string | number[]`:

```typescript
type Colors = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue';
type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];

const palette = {
  red: [255, 0, 0],
  green: '#00ff00',
  bleu: [0, 0, 255],
  //  ~~~~ The typo is now caught!
} satisfies Record<Colors, string | RGB>;

// Both of these methods are still accessible!
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);
const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```
