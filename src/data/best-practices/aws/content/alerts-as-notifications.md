# Alerts as Notifications

> Get your alerts to become notifications.

If you've set everything up correctly, your health checks should automatically destroy bad instances and spawn new ones. There's usually no action to take when getting a CloudWatch alert, as everything should be automated. If you're getting alerts where manual intervention is required, do a post-mortem and figure out if there's a way you can automate the action in future. The last time I had an actionable alert from CloudWatch was about a year ago, and it's extremely awesome not to be woken up at 4am for ops alerts any more.
