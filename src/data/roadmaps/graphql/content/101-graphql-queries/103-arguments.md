# Arguments

Arguments in GraphQL are pieces of information that are passed to a field or a directive to specify additional details about how the field should be executed. They can be used to filter, sort, or paginate data, or to specify additional options when creating, updating, or deleting data. They can be passed as key-value pairs, defined as variables, and can be optional or required.
