# Resource Usage

In server-side game development, **resource usage** broadly refers to how a game uses the server's computational power, memory, storage, and networking capabilities. These resources are crucial in assuring overall game performance and responsiveness. When monitoring resource usage, you typically pay attention to CPU usage, memory utilization, storage capacity, network bandwidth, and database performance. Server-side code must be developed and optimized with these resources in mind, as inefficient code can lead to increased resource usage, potentially causing lag, disconnections, or crashes. Key elements like scalable architecture and serverless technologies are primarily employed to efficiently manage and balance resource usage. Tools and automated solutions are commonly utilized to monitor and manage these resources in real-time, allowing developers to identify potential issues and optimize accordingly.
