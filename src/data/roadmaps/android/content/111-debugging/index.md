# Debugging

"Debugging" is a critical step in the app development process. In Android development, it includes identifying and fixing errors, or bugs, in your code. You can debug Android apps using several tools and techniques. For example, Android Studio, the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for Android, comes with a built-in debugging tool, the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). This command-line tool allows you to communicate your device and perform various actions like installing and debugging apps. Android Studio also supports step-by-step debugging, where you can set breakpoints in your code and inspect the application state at those points. Additionally, you can use log messages to monitor the behavior of your application, which is especially useful for understanding the state of your app during runtime. Remember that before debugging, you need to build your app in debug mode.
