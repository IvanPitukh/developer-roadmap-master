# gevent

gevent is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to the event loop.
It is based on non-blocking IO (libevent/libev) and lightweight greenlets. Non-blocking IO means requests waiting for network IO won't block other requests; greenlets mean we can continue to write code in synchronous style.
