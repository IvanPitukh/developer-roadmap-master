# Koin

[Koin](https://insert-koin.io) is a lightweight dependency injection framework developed specifically for Kotlin developers. It uses functional resolution only - no proxy, no code generation, no reflection, and offers simplicity by leveraging Kotlin's language features. While Koin is not related to the Android platform, it provides specific extensions enabling an efficient integration into your Android applications, including [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) and [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html), amongst others.
