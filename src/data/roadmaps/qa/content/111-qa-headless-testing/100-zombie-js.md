# Zombie.js

Zombie.js allows you to run Unit or Integration tests without a real web browser. Instead, it uses a simulated browser where it stores the HTML code and runs the JavaScript you may have in your HTML page. This means that an HTML page doesnâ€™t need to be displayed, saving precious time that would otherwise be occupied rendering it.
