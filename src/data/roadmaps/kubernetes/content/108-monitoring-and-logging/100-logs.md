# Logs

Logs are generated by containerized applications running on nodes within the cluster. You can access these logs using the kubectl logs command followed by the name of the pod. By default, this command shows the logs from the most recent container in the pod, but you can specify a specific container within the pod by adding the container name to the command. Adding the -f flag to the command allows you to follow the logs in real-time. There are also third-party logging solutions available for Kubernetes, such as the EFK and Prometheus stacks, that provide more advanced logging capabilities and scalability for large-scale applications.
