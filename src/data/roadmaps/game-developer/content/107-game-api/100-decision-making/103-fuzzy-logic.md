# Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy Logic is a mathematical logic method that resolves problem-solving and system control. Unlike traditional binary sets (true or false), fuzzy logic variables have a truth value that ranges in degree between 0 and 1. This allows them to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. In game development, fuzzy logic is often used in artificial intelligence to make the game more realistic. For instance, it can be used to program non-player characters (NPCs) who respond to situational changes dynamically, making the gameplay more engaging and interactive.
