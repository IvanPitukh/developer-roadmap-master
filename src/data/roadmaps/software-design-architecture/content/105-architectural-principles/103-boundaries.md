# Boundaries

In software architecture, boundaries refer to the interfaces or the points of separation between different components or systems. These boundaries can be physical, such as between different microservices in a distributed system, or logical, such as between different layers in an application.

Boundaries are important because they define the points of interaction between different components or systems, and they dictate how those components or systems will communicate with each other. By defining clear boundaries, it makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain the system, as the interactions between components or systems are well-defined and easy to reason about.
