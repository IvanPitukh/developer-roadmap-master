# MongoDB Security

In this section, we are going to learn about MongoDB security, its importance, and best practices to ensure a secure and robust MongoDB deployment. Security is crucial for protecting your data and keeping unauthorized access at bay. MongoDB provides several security mechanisms and features to help you safeguard your data.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. MongoDB supports multiple authentication mechanisms, including:

- **SCRAM**: Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the default authentication mechanism in MongoDB. It's a modern, secure, and password-based authentication method.
- **x.509**: MongoDB supports x.509 certificate-based authentication for both clients and servers.
- **LDAP**: MongoDB Enterprise Edition provides support for proxy authentication through a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server.
- **Kerberos**: MongoDB Enterprise Edition also supports Kerberos-based authentication.

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of granting access and privileges to authenticated users. MongoDB authorization model revolves around the concept of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. Roles grant privileges, and users are assigned one or more roles to define their access. MongoDB provides a set of built-in roles:

- Read
- ReadWrite
- dbAdmin
- userAdmin
- clusterAdmin
- backup
- restore

You can also create custom roles tailored to your specific needs.

## Encryption

Encryption plays a vital role in securing your data both at rest and in transit:

- **Encryption at Rest**: MongoDB Enterprise Edition provides an encryption-at-rest feature using the WiredTiger storage engine. This feature encrypts all data files and logs with algorithms such as AES256-GCM.
- **Encryption in Transit**: MongoDB supports [Transport Layer Security (TLS)]() and [Secure Socket Layers (SSL)]() to encrypt data during transfer between client and server.

## Auditing

Auditing consists of capturing and maintaining traceable records of system activities. It helps you gain insight into how your MongoDB deployment is being used and assists in meeting regulatory or compliance needs. MongoDB Enterprise Edition provides auditing capabilities that can be configured according to business requirements.

## Other Security Best Practices

Here are some additional best practices to ensure a secure MongoDB deployment:

- Enable access control and disable anonymous access
- Limit network exposure by binding to private IP addresses and using firewalls
- Configure role-based authorization
- Rotate X.509 certificates and limit their validity period
- Use encryption for data at rest and during transit
- Employ strong and unique passwords
- Enable auditing and monitor logs
- Regularly update and patch MongoDB

In conclusion, MongoDB provides a comprehensive security framework to protect your data and applications from unauthorized access and attacks. By understanding and implementing various MongoDB security features, you can ensure the safety and integrity of your database systems.
