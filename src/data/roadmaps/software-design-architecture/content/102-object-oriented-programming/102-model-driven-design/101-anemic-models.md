# Anemic Models

An Anemic model, also known as an anemic domain model, is a type of domain model in which the domain objects only contain data (attributes) and lack behavior. An anemic model often results in the use of data-transfer objects (DTOs) and service layer to handle the behavior.

An anemic model is considered an anti-pattern in object-oriented programming (OOP) because it violates the principles of encapsulation and separation of concerns. In an anemic model, the behavior is separated from the data, and is typically implemented in a separate service layer, which can lead to a complex, tightly coupled, and hard-to-maintain codebase.
