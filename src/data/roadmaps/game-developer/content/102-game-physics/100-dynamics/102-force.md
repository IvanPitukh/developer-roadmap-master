# Force

**Force** is a vital concept in game development, especially when crafting physics in games. In the context of game physics, 'Force' is an influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. It's typically implemented in game engines, with part of the physics simulation that computes forces like gravity, friction, or custom forces defined by the developer. Incorporating forces gives a realistic feel to the game, allowing objects to interact naturally following the laws of physics. This is central in genres like racing games, sports games, and any game featuring physical interactions between objects. Remember that `F = ma`, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass. The balance and manipulation of these forces are integral to dynamic, immersive gameplay.
