# Ansible for PostgreSQL Configuration Management

Ansible is a widely used open-source configuration management and provisioning tool that helps automate many tasks for managing servers, databases, and applications. It uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML to define automation scripts, known as "playbooks." In this section, we'll explore how Ansible can help manage PostgreSQL configurations.

## Key Features of Ansible

- Agentless: Ansible does not require installing any agents or software on the servers being managed, making it easy to set up and maintain.
- Playbooks: Playbooks are the core component of Ansible, and they define automation tasks using YAML. They are simple to understand and write.
- Modules: Ansible modules are reusable components that perform specific actions, such as installing packages, creating databases, or managing services. There are numerous built-in modules for managing PostgreSQL.
- Idempotent: Ansible ensures that playbook runs have the same effect, regardless of how many times they are executed. This ensures consistent server and application configuration.
- Inventory: Ansible uses an inventory to track and manage hosts. It is a flexible system that can group and organize servers based on their characteristics or functions.

## Using Ansible with PostgreSQL

- **Install Ansible**: First, you'll need to install Ansible on your control machine (the machine where you'll execute playbooks from), using your package manager or following the official [installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

- **Create a playbook**: Create a new playbook file (e.g., `postgres_setup.yml`) to define the automation tasks for PostgreSQL. In this file, you'll write YAML instructions to perform tasks like installation, configuration, and database setup.

- **Use the PostgreSQL modules**: Ansible has built-in support for PostgreSQL through several modules, such as `postgresql_db`, `postgresql_user`, and `postgresql_privs`. Use these modules in your playbooks to manage your PostgreSQL server and databases.

- **Apply the playbook**: Once you have created the playbook, you can apply it with the `ansible-playbook` command, specifying the inventory file and the target hosts.

Example playbook for installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu:

```yaml
---
- name: Install PostgreSQL
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt: update_cache=yes cache_valid_time=3600

    - name: Install required packages
      apt: name={{ item }} state=present
      loop:
        - python3-psycopg2
        - postgresql
        - postgresql-contrib

    - name: Configure PostgreSQL
      block:
        - name: Add custom configuration
          template:
            src: templates/pg_hba.conf.j2
            dest: /etc/postgresql/{{ postgres_version }}/main/pg_hba.conf
          notify: Restart PostgreSQL

        - name: Reload configuration
          systemd: name=postgresql state=reloaded
  handlers:
    - name: Restart PostgreSQL
      systemd: name=postgresql state=restarted
```

In this example, the playbook installs the required packages, configures PostgreSQL using a custom `pg_hba.conf` file (from a Jinja2 template), and then reloads and restarts the PostgreSQL service.

## pgLift for Ansible

pgLift is a PostgreSQL automation tool that helps you manage your PostgreSQL servers and databases. It includes a set of Ansible modules that can be used to automate common tasks, such as creating databases, users, and extensions, or managing replication and backups.

pgLift modules are available on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/pglift), and can be installed using the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install pglift.pglift
```

Once installed, you can use the modules in your playbooks:

```yaml
---
- name: Create a database
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a database
      pglift.pglift.postgresql_db:
        name: mydb
        owner: myuser
        encoding: UTF8
        lc_collate: en_US.UTF-8
        lc_ctype: en_US.UTF-8
        template: template0
        state: present
```

## Conclusion

Ansible is a powerful configuration management tool that can greatly simplify the maintenance and deployment of PostgreSQL servers. By using Ansible playbooks and PostgreSQL modules, you can automate repetitive tasks, ensure consistent configurations, and reduce human error.
