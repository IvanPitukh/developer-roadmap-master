# RxKotlin

`RxKotlin` is a lightweight language extension to Java for Android development, enabling Android apps to be built using Kotlin with Reactivex. It brings the power of reactive programming paradigm to Kotlin, extending its capabilities for processing asynchronous streams of data. It allows you to express static (e.g., already known) or dynamic (e.g., future unknown) data streams, and perform various operations on them easily. Key concepts of `RxKotlin` include Observables, Observers and Schedulers. Observables represent the data streams, Observers interact with the data stream, and Schedulers determine on which thread operations are performed. RxKotlin helps manage background tasks, handle asynchronous data streams, and implement complex UIs, among others. It is especially beneficial for mobile development where UI thread and background thread coordination is essential.
