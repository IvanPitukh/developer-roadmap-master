# Running Containers with `docker run`

In this section, we'll discuss the `docker run` command, which enables you to run Docker containers. The `docker run` command creates a new container from the specified image and starts it. 

The basic syntax for the `docker run` command is as follows:

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

- `OPTIONS`: These are command-line flags that can be used to adjust the container's settings, like memory constraints, ports, environment variables, etc.
- `IMAGE`: The Docker image that the container will run. This can be an image from Docker Hub or your own image that is stored locally.
- `COMMAND`: This is the command that will be executed inside the container when it starts. If not specified, the default entrypoint of the image will be used.
- `ARG...`: These are optional arguments that can be passed to the command being executed.

## Commonly used Options

Here are some commonly used options with `docker run`:

- `--name`: Assign a name to the container, making it easier to identify and manage.
- `-p, --publish`: Publish a container's port(s) to the host. This is useful when you want to access the services running inside the container from outside the container.
- `-e, --env`: Set environment variables inside the container. You can use this option multiple times to set multiple variables.
- `-d, --detach`: Run the container in detached mode, running the container in the background and not showing logs in the console.
- `-v, --volume`: Bind mount a volume from the host to the container. This is helpful in persisting data generated by the container or sharing files between host and container.

## Examples

Here are some sample commands to help you understand how to use `docker run`:

- Run an interactive session of an Ubuntu container:

```bash
docker run -it --name=my-ubuntu ubuntu
```

- Run an Nginx web server and publish the port 80 on the host:

```bash
docker run -d --name=my-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```

- Run a MySQL container with custom environment variables for configuring the database:

```bash
docker run -d --name=my-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -p 3306:3306 mysql
```

- Run a container with a bind-mounted volume:

```bash
docker run -d --name=my-data -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container some-image
```
