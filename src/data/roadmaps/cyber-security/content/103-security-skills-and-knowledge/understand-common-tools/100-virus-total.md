# VirusTotal

[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) is a free online service that analyzes files and URLs to detect viruses, worms, trojans, and other kinds of malicious content. It uses multiple antivirus engines and website scanners to provide a comprehensive report on the security status of a file or website.

VirusTotal is not a substitute for traditional antivirus software, but it can be used as a complementary tool to assess the security of specific files and websites. Key features of VirusTotal include:

- **File analysis:** Users can upload a file (up to 650MB) to the VirusTotal platform, where it will be analyzed by a variety of antivirus engines. The platform then provides a report that shows if any of the antivirus engines flagged the file as suspicious or malicious.
- **URL analysis:** Users can submit a URL to VirusTotal for scanning, and the platform will analyze the website using multiple website scanners, such as blacklisting services and domain reputation tools, to determine if the site is a potential security risk.
- **APIs and integrations:** VirusTotal offers a public API that allows developers to access its resources programmatically. This means you can integrate VirusTotal's features into your own tools or applications, enhancing your security capabilities with the power of multiple antivirus engines.
- **Community and collaboration:** VirusTotal enables users to create a free account, which grants them access to a range of additional features, such as sharing comments and opinions about files and URLs with other users. This allows the community to work together to better understand and detect potential security threats.

When encountering a suspicious file or website, consider using VirusTotal as an additional resource to better understand the potential risks associated with it. However, keep in mind that no security tool is infallible, and maintaining a layered approach to cybersecurity should always be a top priority.
