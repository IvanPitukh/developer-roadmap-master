# Goal Oriented Behavior

Goal oriented behavior in game development refers to the artificial intelligence algorithms employed that give non-player characters (NPCs) the ability to make decisions based on certain objectives or tasks. These NPCs analyze the circumstances in the game environment, formulate a plan to achieve specific goals, and then execute it. The degree of sophistication in these algorithms can range from simple pathways to complex problem-solving solutions. As the behavior models are not hard-coded, it provides NPCs with greater adaptability and autonomy.
