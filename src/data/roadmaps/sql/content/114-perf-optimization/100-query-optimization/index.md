# Query Optimization Techniques

SQL Query Optimization is a crucial aspect of database management, aiming to maximize the speed and efficiency of SQL queries. Optimization takes into consideration a variety of factors like the query structure, data distribution, hardware specifics, and data-indexing.

## 1. Utilize Indexes:

Indexes enable the database engine to quickly find records just like an index in a book helps facilitate faster information location. 

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...); 
```

## 2. Use Joins instead of Multiple Queries:

Multiple separate queries to retrieve data can be merged into a single JOIN query for a more efficient process.

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

## 3. Limit the Number of Rows:

Only request the number of rows you need. The `LIMIT` clause reduces the number of records returned by a SQL statement. 

```sql
SELECT column FROM table 
ORDER BY column DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## 4. Avoid SELECT * :

Select only the columns you need to prevent the overhead of loading unnecessary data.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table;
```

## 5. Use WHERE instead of HAVING for Filtering:
`WHERE` clause filters records before grouping while `HAVING` filters after. Utilizing `WHERE` can optimize the query performance.
 
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(column2)
FROM table
WHERE condition 
GROUP BY column1;
```

## 6. If Possible Avoid the use of Subqueries:

A subquery is a SQL query enclosed in a larger SQL query. Often they may result in complex and less optimized queries.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
WHERE column_name operator
   (SELECT column_name(s) from table2);
```

Remember there's no universal optimal solution, each SQL query will have its specific optimization strategies.
