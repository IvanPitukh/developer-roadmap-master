# Resource Health

Resource health monitoring in Kubernetes involves monitoring the health and availability of resources such as pods, nodes, and containers. It helps administrators identify and troubleshoot issues that may affect the system's performance and availability using tools such as Kubernetes Dashboard, Prometheus, or Grafana. Resource health monitoring also helps ensure that the system is resilient to failures and can recover quickly from any disruptions. It is an important part of managing a Kubernetes cluster and ensures the reliability, availability, and scalability of the system.
