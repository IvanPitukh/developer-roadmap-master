# Shadow

Shadows contribute significantly to the realism of a virtual scene in gaming. They play a pivotal role in determining an object's position relative to other objects and surfaces. Shadows are largely incorporated through two major techniques in game development: 'Shadow Mapping' and 'Shadow Volumes'. Shadow Mapping is a process that involves creating a depth map from the light source's point of view. Shadow Volumes, on the other hand, use stencil buffers to draw shadows onto scenes. These are computationally intense processes which can be optimized using various techniques such as Cascaded Shadow Maps, and Umbra and Penumbra calculations. Furthermore, developers have the challenge to implement dynamic shadows that react to changing light sources and positions, as well as static shadows for non-moving objects. It's essential that developers learn how to implement, optimize and balance shadows effectively to provide immersive and dynamic game play experiences.
