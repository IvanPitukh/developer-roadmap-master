# Event-Driven Process Chain Model (EPC)

The Event Driven Process Chain (EPC) model is a flowchart-based diagramming method that supports the documentation and analysis of business processes. EPCs are frequently used in the field of UX design to aid in identifying areas for optimization and improvement.

In an EPC model, events, functions, and control flow are the primary components.

- **Event**: Represents a specific point in time, such as the start, end or a change in a process.
- **Function**: Represents an action or task that needs to be performed. Functions typically connect to events and other functions within a process chain.
- **Control Flow**: Illustrates the flow of activities in the process chain by connecting events and functions with arrows, showing the sequence of tasks.

Creating an EPC model involves the following steps:

- Identify the main activities and events in the process to be modeled.
- Define the flow of activities by connecting events and functions using arrows.
- Identify decision points or branches in the process, where alternative paths may be followed.
- Analyze the model to identify areas for improvement, such as bottlenecks, inefficiencies or redundancies.

EPC models are beneficial for UX designers as they provide a clear, visual representation of the business processes. This helps in understanding how a user's interactions with a product or service are tied to the overall process flow. Consequently, insights gained from EPC models can inform the UX design process in terms of the required steps and interactions, potential pain points, and opportunities for innovation.
