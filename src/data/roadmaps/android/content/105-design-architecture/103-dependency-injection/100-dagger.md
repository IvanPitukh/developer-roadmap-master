# Dagger

[Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square that's focused on simplicity and speed. Dagger's primary focus is on compile-time analysis of dependencies, code simplicity, and clarity. It uses annotations to define dependencies, thus aiding in easy readability and understanding of the code. Dagger also eliminates the use of reflection to inject dependencies, thus boosting performance. It offers custom scopes to control the lifespan of instances and ensures that dependencies are Singleton across the entire lifespan of certain scopes.
