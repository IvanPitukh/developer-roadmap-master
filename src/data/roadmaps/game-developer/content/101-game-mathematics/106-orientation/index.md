# Curve

In the context of game development, **Orientation** refers to the aspect or direction in which an object is pointed in a 3D space. To determine an object's orientation in 3D space, we typically use three angles namely: pitch, yaw, and roll collectively known as Euler's angles. **Pitch** is the rotation around the X-axis, **Yaw** around the Y-axis and **Roll** around the Z-axis. Alternatively, orientation can also be represented using a Quaternion. Quaternions have the advantage of avoiding a problem known as Gimbal lock (a loss of one degree of freedom in 3D space), present when using Euler's angles.
