# MongoDB Audit

Auditing is a critical aspect of maintaining the security and compliance of your database systems. MongoDB provides auditing capabilities to track and log various activities occurring within your MongoDB deployment. This information can be vital for identifying potential security risks, troubleshooting issues, and meeting regulatory compliance requirements such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS.

## How MongoDB Auditing Works

MongoDB auditing enables you to capture detailed information about database events, such as user authentication, command execution, and changes to the database configuration. The audit log provides complete visibility into database operations, which can be analyzed and monitored in real-time or stored for future examination.

## Enabling MongoDB Auditing

To enable auditing in MongoDB, you must use MongoDB Enterprise Advanced or an equivalent Atlas tier. Once you have the required version, you can enable auditing by modifying your `mongod` or `mongos` configuration file to include the `auditLog` option, specifying the format, destination, and filter criteria for the audit events.

Example:

```yaml
auditLog:
  destination: file
  format: JSON
  path: '/path/to/audit/log/file.json'
  filter: "{ atype: { $in: ['authenticate', 'createUser', 'dropUser', 'revokeRolesFromUser'] }}"
```

## Audit Log Formats

MongoDB audit logs can be generated in two formats:

- **BSON**: The default format for audit logs, BSON is space-efficient and simplifies parsing of audit events by MongoDB tools.

- **JSON**: A human-readable representation of audit events, JSON format can be read and processed by most log management systems.

## Filtering Audit Events

To specify which events should be audited, you can provide a filter expression to the `auditLog.filter` configuration parameter.
Example:

```yaml
auditLog:
  filter: "{ atype: { $in: ['authCheck', 'createUser', 'dropUser', 'revokeRolesFromUser'] }}"
```

You can customize the filter criteria to suit your security requirements and avoid capturing unnecessary events.

## Analyzing and Monitoring Audit Logs

You can analyze and monitor MongoDB audit logs using various tools, including log analysis software, SIEM systems, or built-in MongoDB utilities like `mongoaudit`. Regular audits can help identify unusual activities, data breaches, or unauthorized access, therefore ensuring the continued security and integrity of your database environment.

In conclusion, MongoDB's auditing feature is an essential component of a robust security strategy. By enabling audit logging and regularly analyzing the captured events, you can ensure the safety, performance, and compliance of your MongoDB deployment.
