# Transactions

Transactions are a fundamental concept in database management systems, allowing multiple statements to be executed within a single transaction context. In PostgreSQL, transactions provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, which ensure that your data remains in a consistent state even during concurrent access or system crashes.

In this section, we will discuss the following aspects of transactions in PostgreSQL:

- **Transaction Control**: How to start, commit, and rollback a transaction.
- **Savepoints**: Creating and managing savepoints within a transaction.
- **Concurrency Control**: Understanding isolation levels and concurrency issues.
- **Locking**: How to acquire and release locks for concurrent access.

## Transaction Control

Transactions in PostgreSQL can be controlled using the following SQL commands:

- `BEGIN`: Starts a new transaction.
- `COMMIT`: Ends the current transaction and makes all changes permanent.
- `ROLLBACK`: Ends the current transaction, discarding all changes made.

Example:

```sql
BEGIN;
-- Perform multiple SQL statements here
COMMIT;
```

## Savepoints

Savepoints allow you to create intermediate points within a transaction, to which you can rollback without discarding the entire transaction. They are useful when you need to undo part of a transaction without affecting other parts of the transaction.

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Perform some SQL statements

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

-- Perform more SQL statements

-- Rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

-- Continue working and commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

## Concurrency Control

Isolation levels are used to control the visibility of data in a transaction with respect to other concurrent transactions. PostgreSQL supports four isolation levels:

- `READ UNCOMMITTED`: Allows transactions to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
- `READ COMMITTED`: Allows transactions to see changes made by other transactions only after they are committed.
- `REPEATABLE READ`: Guarantees that a transaction sees a consistent view of data for the entire length of the transaction.
- `SERIALIZABLE`: Enforces serial execution order of transactions, providing the highest level of isolation.

You can set the transaction isolation level using the following command:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL level_name;
```

## Locking

Locks prevent multiple transactions from conflicting with each other when accessing shared resources. PostgreSQL provides various lock modes, such as `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, and `FOR KEY SHARE`.

Example:

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
-- Perform updates or deletions here
COMMIT;
```

In summary, understanding and utilizing transactions in PostgreSQL is essential for ensuring data consistency and managing concurrent access to your data. By leveraging transaction control, savepoints, concurrency control, and locking, you can build robust and reliable applications that work seamlessly with PostgreSQL.
