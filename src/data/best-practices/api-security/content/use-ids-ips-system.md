# Use IDS/IPS Systems

> Use IDS and/or IPS systems to detect and block attacks.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can be used to detect and block attacks. These systems can be configured to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic, and detect any suspicious activity. If any suspicious activity is detected, the systems can be configured to block the traffic, preventing the attack from succeeding. IDS and IPS systems can be implemented using various tools and technologies such as network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS). These systems can be deployed alongside the API, and configured to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic. The systems can be configured to provide real-time alerts to security teams if any suspicious activity is detected, allowing for immediate action to be taken.
