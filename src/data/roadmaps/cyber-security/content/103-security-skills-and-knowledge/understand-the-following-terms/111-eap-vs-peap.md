# EAP vs PEAP

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP is an authentication framework that provides different authentication methods for various networks. It supports multiple authentication types, allowing organizations to choose the most suitable one to secure their network. EAP operates in the link layer of the OSI model and is commonly used in wireless networks and remote access connections.

_Pros:_

- Highly flexible, supports multiple authentication methods
- Can be easily updated to use new authentication methods

_Cons:_

- Not an authentication mechanism itself, but a framework
- Requires the use of an additional authentication server

## Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)

PEAP is a popular EAP method designed to provide secure communication within an organization's network. It creates a secure tunnel between the client and the authentication server using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which encapsulates other EAP methods within that tunnel. This process adds an extra layer of security by protecting the authentication process from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

_Pros:_

- Encrypts authentication data, preventing unauthorized access
- Works alongside other EAP methods
- Simplifies the deployment of client certificates

_Cons:_

- Requires the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- May not be supported by all devices and network configurations

In summary:

- EAP is a flexible authentication framework that supports various authentication methods, while PEAP is an EAP method that adds a layer of security by utilizing TLS.
- EAP provides an adaptable solution for organizations looking for diverse authentication options, whereas PEAP focuses on enhancing security by encrypting the authentication process.
- Choosing between EAP and PEAP will depend on your organization's security requirements, network infrastructure, and compatibility with devices or systems.
