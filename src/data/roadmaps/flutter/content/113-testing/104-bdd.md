# BDD

Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders to define and verify the behavior of an application. BDD uses natural language to describe the expected behavior of the application and provides a shared understanding of the requirements for the development team.

In Flutter, BDD can be applied using the `flutter_driver` package, which provides a testing framework for writing and running integration tests. BDD can be used to write tests that verify the behavior of the app as a whole, rather than individual widgets or functions.
