# CIS

The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** is a non-profit organization that focuses on enhancing the cybersecurity posture of individuals, organizations, and governments around the world. CIS offers various tools, best practices, guidelines, and frameworks that help in defending against common cyber threats.

## CIS Critical Security Controls

One of the most significant contributions of CIS is the **CIS Critical Security Controls (CSC)**, which are a set of prioritized actions that aim to improve cyber defense. These controls have been developed by a community of IT security experts and are regularly updated to remain relevant in the ever-evolving threat landscape.

The CIS Critical Security Controls are divided into three categories:

- Basic Controls: Foundational security measures that every organization should implement.
- Foundational Controls: Additional security measures providing a more robust defense.
- Organizational Controls: Governance and management-related processes, ensuring the continuity and effectiveness of the security program.

The following are the key objectives of implementing CIS Critical Security Controls:

- Strengthen the security posture of an organization.
- Protect sensitive information and valuable assets.
- Identify and prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities.
- Reduce the attack surface and risks associated with cyber threats.

## CIS Benchmarks

CIS also provides **CIS Benchmarks**, which are a set of configuration guidelines for various technologies, including operating systems, cloud providers, and applications. These benchmarks offer practical guidance for securing systems and improving overall cybersecurity posture.

CIS Benchmarks provide the following benefits:

- Improve system security by reducing the attack surface.
- Assist in meeting compliance requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.
- Enable organizations to adopt best practices in configuration management.
- Facilitate audit preparation and maintaining system documentation.

In summary, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) offers valuable resources that can help organizations bolster their security posture. The CIS Critical Security Controls and CIS Benchmarks are practical tools that provide guidance on implementing security measures to mitigate cyber threats effectively. By following these guidelines, organizations can improve their resilience and better protect themselves in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
