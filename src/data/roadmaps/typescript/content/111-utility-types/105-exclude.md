# Exclude

Exclude constructs a type by excluding from UnionType all union members that are assignable to ExcludedMembers.

```typescript
type T0 = Exclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a'>; // "b" | "c"
type T1 = Exclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a' | 'b'>; // "c"
type T2 = Exclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>; // string | number
```
