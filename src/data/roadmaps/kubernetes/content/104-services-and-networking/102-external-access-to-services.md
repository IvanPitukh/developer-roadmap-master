# External Access to Services

External access to Kubernetes (k8s) Services allows external clients to access pods and services running in the cluster. There are multiple ways to enable external access to Services in k8s, including NodePorts, LoadBalancers, and Ingress. Ingress is a Kubernetes object that provides a flexible way to manage external access, routing traffic to Services based on URL or host. External access is essential to ensure the scalability and reliability of Kubernetes deployments.
