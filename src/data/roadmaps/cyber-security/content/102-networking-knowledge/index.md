# Networking Knowledge

In the world of cyber security, having a strong foundation in networking knowledge is crucial. It's important to understand the fundamental concepts and mechanisms that govern how data is transferred, communicated, and secured across digital networks.

## Topics

- **Network Architecture**: Learn about the different networking models, such as the OSI model and TCP/IP model, which define how data is structured, transmitted, and received in a network.

- **Network Protocols**: Familiarize yourself with various network protocols that are essential for effective communication between devices, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. These protocols ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely across networks.

- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Gain an understanding of IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), how they are assigned, and how subnetting works to divide networks into smaller segments for better management and security.

- **Routing and Switching**: Learn about the roles of routers and switches in a network, as well as related technologies and protocols like DHCP, NAT, and various routing protocols (such as OSPF and BGP).

- **Wireless Networking**: Delve into the world of wireless networks by studying the different types of wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks. Understand the security concerns and best practices associated with wireless communication.

- **Network Security**: Explore various techniques and tools used to defend networks from cyber threats, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and VPNs. Learn about security protocols like SSL/TLS, encryption algorithms, and secure access control mechanisms.

- **Network Troubleshooting**: Understand common network issues and how to resolve them, using various network troubleshooting tools and methodologies like ping, traceroute, and Wireshark.

By developing a strong foundation in networking knowledge, you will be well-equipped to tackle various cyber security challenges and protect your digital assets from potential threats. Remember, the ever-evolving landscape of cyber security demands continuous learning and updating of skills to stay ahead in the game.
