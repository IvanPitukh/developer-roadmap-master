# Set Operations in PostgreSQL

In this section, we will discuss set operations that are available in PostgreSQL. These operations are useful when you need to perform actions on whole sets of data, such as merging or comparing them. Set operations include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, and they can be vital tools in querying complex datasets.

## UNION

The `UNION` operation is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. It returns all unique rows from the combined result-set, removing duplicate records. The basic syntax for a UNION operation is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

*Note: The number and order of the columns in both SELECT statements must be the same, and their data types must be compatible.*

To include duplicate records in the result-set, use the `UNION ALL` operation instead:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1 
UNION ALL 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## INTERSECT

The `INTERSECT` operation is used to return the common rows of two or more SELECT statements, i.e., the rows that appear in both result-sets. It has a syntax similar to that of UNION:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

*Note: As with UNION, the number and order of the columns, as well as their data types, must be compatible between both SELECT statements.*

## EXCEPT

The `EXCEPT` operation is used to return the rows from the first SELECT statement that do not appear in the second SELECT statement. This operation is useful for finding the difference between two datasets. The syntax for EXCEPT is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

*Note: Again, the number and order of the columns and their data types must be compatible between both SELECT statements.*

## Conclusion

In this section, we looked at the set operations `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` in PostgreSQL. They are powerful tools for combining and comparing datasets, and mastering their use will enhance your SQL querying capabilities. In the next section, we will discuss more advanced topics to further deepen your understanding of PostgreSQL.
