# Type Compatibility

TypeScript uses structural typing to determine type compatibility. This means that two types are considered compatible if they have the same structure, regardless of their names.

Here's an example of type compatibility in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

let p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
let p2: { x: number; y: number } = p1;

console.log(p2.x); // Output: 10
```

In this example, `p1` has the type `Point`, while `p2` has the type `{ x: number; y: number }`. Despite the fact that the two types have different names, they are considered compatible because they have the same structure. This means that you can assign a value of type `Point` to a variable of type `{ x: number; y: number }`, as we do with `p1` and `p2` in this example.
