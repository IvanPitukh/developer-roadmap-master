# Remind of Prior Commitment to Act

Sometimes, users need a gentle reminder of the commitments or decisions they've made in the past to help them move forward in their user journey. As a UX designer, you can incorporate these reminders to create a sense of urgency and promote desired actions from users.

## Benefits of Reminding Users of Prior Commitments

- **Motivate users to act**: When reminded of a commitment they've already made, users are more likely to follow through with the action, especially if they feel they've invested time or resources toward that action.
- **Create a sense of urgency**: By emphasizing the importance of their commitments, users are more likely to prioritize their tasks and act sooner.
- **Promote consistency**: Reminding users of their prior commitments can promote consistency in their behavior and decision-making, leading to a better user experience.

## Strategies to Remind Users of Prior Commitments

- **Display progress indicators**: Show users how far they have come in a process, such as filling out a form or completing a survey, to remind them of their progress so far.
- **Use notifications**: Send timely notifications or reminders to remind users of their prior commitments, such as appointments they made or tasks they wished to complete.
- **Leverage personalized content**: Customize content to emphasize a user's previous actions, for example, by showing related products based on prior purchases, or pre-filling forms with previously entered data.
- **Create social proof**: Showcase testimonials, reviews, or follower counts to remind users of their decision to join a community or use a product, creating a sense of belonging and reinforcing their initial commitment.

By incorporating reminders of prior commitments in the user experience, you can make users feel more invested in the process, create a sense of urgency, and ultimately, improve the overall UX design.
