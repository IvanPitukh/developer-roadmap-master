# Avoid Logging Sensitive Data

> Ensure that you aren't logging any sensitive data.

Make sure that you are not logging any sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information. This is because logging sensitive data can expose it to attackers, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to your system or data. Additionally, logging sensitive data can violate data privacy laws and regulations, exposing you to legal liability.
