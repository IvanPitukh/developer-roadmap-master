# Link Capacity

Link capacity, also known as bandwidth, refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network link within a given period of time. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), gigabits per second (Gbps), or terabits per second (Tbps). The link capacity is a critical factor in determining the throughput and latency of a server, impacting the overall performance and efficiency of the network communication. Please note that link capacity can be affected by various factors such as the quality of the transmission medium, the distance between the source and destination, and the network congestion.
