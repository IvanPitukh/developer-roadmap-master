# Database Security Best Practices

Database security is key in ensuring sensitive information is kept intact and isn't exposed to a malicious or accidental breach. Here are some best practices related to SQL security:

## 1. Least Privilege Principle

This principle states that a user should have the minimum levels of access necessary and nothing more. For large systems, this could require a good deal of planning.

## 2. Regular Updates

Always keep SQL Server patched and updated to gain the benefit of the most recent security updates.

## 3. Complex and Secure Passwords

Passwords should be complex and frequently changed. Alongside the use of `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, this is the front line of defense.

## 4. Limiting Remote Access

If remote connections to the SQL server are not necessary, it is best to disable it.

## 5. Avoid Using SQL Server Admin Account

You should avoid using the SQL Server admin account for regular database operations to limit security risk. 

## 6. Encrypt Communication

To protect against data sniffing, all communication between SQL Server and applications should be encrypted.

## 7. Database Backups

Regular database backups are crucial for data integrity if there happens to be a data loss. 

## 8. Monitoring and Auditing

Regularly monitor and audit your database operations to keep track of who does what in your database. 

## 9. Regular Vulnerability Scanning

Use a vulnerability scanner to assess the security posture of your SQL.

## 10. SQL Injection

SQL injection can be reduced by using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

These practices can significantly improve your SQL security posture. However, remember that security is not a one-time effort, but a continuous process. Regular assessment and necessary updates are key.  Remember to keep an eye on security news concerning SQL Server and regularly check for new security risks or vulnerabilities.
