# Refresh Control

`RefreshControl` is a component in React Native that is used to provide pull-to-refresh functionality for scrollable components like `ScrollView`, `ListView`, and `FlatList`. 

## How to use RefreshControl:

- Import `RefreshControl` from 'react-native':
   ```
   import { RefreshControl } from 'react-native';
   ```
- Add `RefreshControl` to a scrollable component (`ScrollView`, `ListView`, or `FlatList`). Here is an example with `FlatList`:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   import { FlatList, RefreshControl, Text } from 'react-native';

   const App = () => {
       const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

       const fetchData = () => {
           // Fetch the data and update your state accordingly
       };

       const onRefresh = () => {
           setRefreshing(true);
           fetchData().then(() => {
               setRefreshing(false);
           });
       };

       return (
           <FlatList
               data={['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']}
               renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
               refreshControl={
                   <RefreshControl refreshing={refreshing} onRefresh={onRefresh} />
               }
           />
       );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

In the example above, we have a `FlatList` that renders a list of items. When the user pulls down the list, the `onRefresh` function is triggered and fetches new data. The `refreshing` state is used to control the visibility of the refresh indicator. When `refreshing` is set to `true`, the refresh indicator is shown. It is hidden when `refreshing` is set to `false`.
