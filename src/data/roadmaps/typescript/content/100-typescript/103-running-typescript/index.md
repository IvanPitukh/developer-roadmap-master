# Running TypeScript

To run TypeScript code, you'll need to have a TypeScript compiler installed. Here's a general process to run TypeScript code:

- Write TypeScript code in a `.ts` file (e.g. `app.ts`)
- Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

- Run the generated JavaScript code using a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js:

```bash
node app.js
```
