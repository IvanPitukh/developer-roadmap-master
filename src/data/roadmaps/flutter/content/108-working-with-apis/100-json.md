# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In Flutter, JSON is used for transmitting data between the client and server, typically over an HTTP connection.

Flutter provides a number of libraries for working with JSON data, including the `dart:convert` library, which provides support for encoding and decoding JSON data.

To encode a Dart object to a JSON string, you can use the `jsonEncode` function from the `dart:convert` library. To decode a JSON string to a Dart object, you can use the jsonDecode function.
