# Testing

***Android Testing*** is a crucial part of the app development process. It involves validating the functionality, performance, usability, and consistency of your app before deploying it to the Play Store. There are two types of testing methods notably used: **Unit testing** and **Instrumentation testing**. Unit testing, as the name suggests, tests each unit or segment of your code separately. It doesn't require Android dependencies and hence, runs faster. Instrumentation testing, on another hand, requires Android dependencies and is slower. Instrumentation testing tests the UIs, simulates user interactions and validates the navigation between different parts of your app. Android provides built-in testing frameworks like `JUnit` for unit testing and `Espresso` for Instrumentation testing. These can effectively test different parts of your app, assuring its robustness.
