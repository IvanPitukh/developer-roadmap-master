# Install and Configure

To install and configure TypeScript in your project, you need to perform the following steps:

- Initialize npm in your project directory by running the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

- Install TypeScript as a project dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

- Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory to specify the compiler options for building your project. For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- Compile your TypeScript code using the following command:

```bash
tsc
```

Note: You can also compile individual TypeScript files by specifying the file name after the tsc command.For example:

```bash
tsc index.ts
```

And you're all set! You can now start writing TypeScript code in your project.
