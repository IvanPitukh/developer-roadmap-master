# Repositories

Repositories are a pattern used in enterprise application development to provide a consistent and abstracted way to access data storage. Repositories act as an abstraction layer between the application and the data storage, providing a consistent and simple API for data access and manipulation.

A repository is a pattern that can be used to organize the data access code and encapsulate the logic of retrieving and storing objects. Repositories provide a way to separate the concerns of the data access from the rest of the application, allowing the application code to be written against an interface and not a specific data storage technology.
