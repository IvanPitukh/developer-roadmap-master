# JSON Web Token

JWT, or JSON-Web-Token, is an open standard for sharing security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
