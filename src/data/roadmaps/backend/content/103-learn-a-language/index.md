# Learn a Language

Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known is that Web Development is majorly classified into two facets: Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously, they both have their respective set of tools and technologies. For instance, when we talk about Frontend Development, there always comes 3 names first and foremost – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend (or you can say server-side) programming language to make the website function along with various other tools & technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.

Pick a language from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core details about its runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.
