# Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package of software that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Docker allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a container, which can then be easily deployed and run on any host machine with Docker installed. This makes it easy to run the same software on different environments, such as development, staging, and production, without worrying about compatibility issues.s
