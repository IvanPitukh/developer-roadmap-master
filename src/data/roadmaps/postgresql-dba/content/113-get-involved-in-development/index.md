# Get Involved in Development

PostgreSQL is an open-source database system developed by a large and active community. By getting involved in the development process, you can help contribute to its growth, learn new skills, and collaborate with other developers around the world. In this section, we'll discuss some ways for you to participate in the PostgreSQL development community.

## Join Mailing Lists and Online Forums

Join various PostgreSQL mailing lists, such as the general discussion list (_pgsql-general_), the development list (_pgsql-hackers_), or other specialized lists to stay up-to-date on discussions related to the project. You can also participate in PostgreSQL-related forums, like Stack Overflow or Reddit, to engage with fellow developers, ask questions, and provide assistance to others.

## Bug Reporting and Testing

Reporting bugs and testing new features are invaluable contributions to improving the quality and stability of PostgreSQL. Before submitting a bug report, make sure to search the official bug tracking system to see if the issue has already been addressed. Additionally, consider testing patches submitted by other developers or contributing tests for new features or functionalities.

## Contribute Code

Contributing code can range from fixing small bugs or optimizing existing features, to adding entirely new functionalities. To start contributing to the PostgreSQL source code, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the [PostgreSQL coding standards](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/source.html) and submit your changes as patches through the PostgreSQL mailing list. Make sure to follow the [patch submission guidelines](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Submitting_a_Patch) to ensure that your contributions are properly reviewed and considered.

## Documentation and Translations

Improving and expanding the official PostgreSQL documentation is crucial for providing accurate and up-to-date information to users. If you have expertise in a particular area, you can help by updating the documentation. Additionally, translating the documentation or interface messages into other languages can help expand the PostgreSQL community by providing resources for non-English speakers.

## Offer Support and Help Others

By helping others in the community, you not only contribute to the overall growth and development of PostgreSQL but also develop your own knowledge and expertise. Participate in online discussions, answer questions, conduct workshops or webinars, and share your experiences and knowledge to help others overcome challenges they may be facing.

## Advocate for PostgreSQL

Promoting and advocating for PostgreSQL in your organization and network can help increase its adoption and visibility. Share your success stories, give talks at conferences, write blog posts, or create tutorials to help encourage more people to explore PostgreSQL as a go-to solution for their database needs.

Remember, the PostgreSQL community thrives on the input and dedication of its members, so don't hesitate to get involved and contribute. Every contribution, no matter how small, can have a positive impact on the project and create a more robust and powerful database system for everyone.
