# Testing Angular Apps

In any software development process, Testing the application plays a vital role. If Bugs and crashes are not figured out and solved they can defame the development company as well as hurt the clients too. But, Angular’s architecture comes with built-in testability features. As soon as you create a new project with Angular CLI, two essential testing tools are installed.They are: Jasmine and Karma. Jasmine is the testing library which structures individual tests into specifications (“specs”) and suites. And Karma is the test runner, which enables the different browsers to run the tests mentioned by Jasmine and the browsers will finally report the test results back.
