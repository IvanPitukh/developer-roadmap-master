# Async-await (C#)

`Async/await` are extensions of Promises in JavaScript that allow for handling asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner. Using `async` keyword before a function, means the function returns a Promise. On the other hand, `await` keyword is used to pause async function execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillments. Before the `await` keyword, the Promise resolves to the actual value. Notably, `await` only works within async function block.
