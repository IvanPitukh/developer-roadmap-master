# Akka.net (C#)

"Akka.NET" is a toolkit and a runtime for designing concurrent and distributed applications. This technology is directly inspired by the Actor Model concept, implementing its principles to create robust and highly functional server-side applications. Akka.NET allows developers to create systems that are capable of handling millions of messages in a concurrent manner while maintaining high performance. It supports actor-based concurrency, network and cloud distribution, and powerful event sourcing techniques. Building systems with Akka.NET involve not only working with primary actors but also working with different types, including the likes of Persistent actors, FSM (Finite State Machine) actors and more. Please remember, Akka.NET is a part of the broader Akka toolkit, which also includes libraries for Java and Scala.
