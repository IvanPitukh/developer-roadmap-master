# OData

OData (Open Data Protocol) is a web protocol for querying and updating data. It is an open standard for creating and consuming RESTful web services. OData is built on top of the HTTP protocol, and it uses the conventions of REST to expose data through a standard interface.

In ASP.NET, OData can be used to create RESTful web services that expose data in a standardized way. OData provides a set of conventions for defining the structure of the data, and it also provides a set of conventions for querying and updating the data.
