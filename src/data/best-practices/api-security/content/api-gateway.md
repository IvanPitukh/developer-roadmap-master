# API Gateway

> Use an API Gateway for caching, Rate Limit policies, and other security features.

An API gateway can make your APIs more secure by providing a centralized point of control for managing and securing API traffic. Here are a few ways an API gateway can improve API security:

- Authentication and authorization: API gateways can handle user authentication and authorization, reducing the burden on individual APIs and improving consistency across the organization. This can include techniques such as JWT verification, OAuth, and other authentication mechanisms.

- Traffic filtering and rate limiting: An API gateway can enforce traffic filtering and rate limiting to protect APIs against DDoS attacks, brute force attacks, and other types of abuse.

- Encryption and decryption: An API gateway can handle encryption and decryption of sensitive data to protect against data breaches and theft.

- Logging and monitoring: An API gateway can provide centralized logging and monitoring of API traffic, helping to identify and respond to security threats and other issues.

- Integration with security tools: An API gateway can be integrated with security tools such as WAFs, SIEMs, and other security tools to provide additional layers of protection.
