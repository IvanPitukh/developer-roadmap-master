# Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA is a library that makes it easy to implement Java Persistence API (JPA) based repositories (a fancy word for "DAO") for Spring applications. It's an abstraction on top of JPA that allows you to use a simpler and more convenient API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases. Spring Data JPA also provides additional functionality such as pagination, dynamic query generation, and more.
