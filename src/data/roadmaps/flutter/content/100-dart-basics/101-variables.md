# Variables

In Flutter, variables are used to store values. There are two types of variables in Flutter:

- local variables: These are declared within a function and are only accessible within that function
- Instance variables: They are declared within a class and are accessible throughout the entire class.

Variables in Flutter can store values of different data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more.
