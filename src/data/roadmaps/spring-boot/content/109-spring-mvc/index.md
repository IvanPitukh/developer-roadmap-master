# Spring MVC

Spring MVC is a web application framework that is part of the Spring Framework. It is designed to make it easy to build web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

In Spring MVC, the application is divided into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the View is responsible for generating the HTML that is sent to the client's web browser, and the Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling incoming HTTP requests and generating the appropriate response.
