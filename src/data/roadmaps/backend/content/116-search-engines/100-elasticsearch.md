# Elasticsearch

Elastic search at its core is a document-oriented search engine. It is a document based database that lets you INSERT, DELETE , RETRIEVE and even perform analytics on the saved records. But, Elastic Search is unlike any other general purpose database you have worked with, in the past. It's essentially a search engine and offers an arsenal of features you can use to retrieve the data stored in it, as per your search criteria. And that too, at lightning speeds.
