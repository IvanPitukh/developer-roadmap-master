# Projection

`Projection` in game mathematics often refers to the method by which three-dimensional images are transferred to a two-dimensional plane, typically a computer screen. There are two main types of projection in game development; `Orthographic Projection` and `Perspective Projection`. In the Orthographic Projection, objects maintain their size regardless of their distance from the camera. This is often used in 2D games or 3D games where perspective is not important. On the other hand, Perspective Projection mimics human eye perspective, where distant objects appear smaller. This method provides a more realistic rendering for 3D games. It's crucial to understand projection in game development because it governs how virtual 3D spaces and objects are displayed on 2D viewing platforms.
