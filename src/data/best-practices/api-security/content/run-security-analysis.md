# Run Security Analysis

> Continuously run security analysis on your code.

Continuous security analysis helps identify and address security vulnerabilities in the codebase before they can be exploited by attackers. It involves using automated tools and manual techniques to scan code for potential weaknesses, such as insecure coding practices, configuration errors, and outdated dependencies. By identifying and fixing vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, the risk of a security breach or data loss can be significantly reduced, improving the overall security posture of the system.
