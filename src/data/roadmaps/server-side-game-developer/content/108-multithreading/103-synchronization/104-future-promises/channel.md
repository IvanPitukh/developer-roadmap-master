# Channel

### Channel

In server-side game development, a **Channel** is used to simplify network coding by providing an efficient and reusable way to send and receive data. Essentially, a channel is a communication pipeline between a client and a server. They are often used in real-time multiplayer games where fast and frequent data transfer is essential. These channels can be implemented using different protocols, the choice of which usually depends on specific game requirements and usage scenarios. For example, TCP channels may be used for reliable data transfer, while UDP channels may be more applicable for fast, unordered data delivery.
