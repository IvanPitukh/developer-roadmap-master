# proxmox

Proxmox is an open-source platform for enterprise-level virtualization. It is a complete server virtualization management solution that allows system administrators to create and manage virtual machines in a unified environment.

## Key Features

- **Server Virtualization**: Proxmox enables you to turn your physical server into multiple virtual servers, each running its own operating system, applications, and services. This helps to maximize server usage and reduce operating costs.

- **High Availability**: Proxmox VE supports high availability and failover. In case of hardware or software failure, automatic migration of virtual machines can prevent downtime for critical applications and services.

- **Storage**: Proxmox offers a variety of storage solution options, including local (LVM, ZFS, directories), network (iSCSI, NFS, GlusterFS, Ceph), and distributed storage (Ceph RBD).

- **Live Migration**: Live migration is a crucial feature that allows you to move running virtual machines from one host to another with minimal downtime.

- **Operating System Support**: Proxmox VE supports a wide range of guest operating systems, including Linux, Windows, BSD, and others.

- **Web Interface**: Proxmox offers a powerful and user-friendly web interface for managing your virtual environment. This allows you to create, start, stop or delete virtual machines, monitor their performance, manage their storage, and more from any web browser.

- **Role-based Access Control**: Proxmox VE provides a role-based access control system, allowing you to create users with specific permissions and assign them to different parts of the Proxmox system.

- **Backup and Restore**: Proxmox offers built-in backup and restore functionality, allowing you to easily create full, incremental, or differential backups of your virtual machines and easily restore them when needed.

## Conclusion

As a powerful and feature-rich virtualization solution, Proxmox Virtual Environment enables administrators to manage their virtual infrastructure more efficiently and reliably. Boasting an easy-to-use web interface, comprehensive storage options, and support for multiple operating systems, Proxmox VE is an excellent choice for managing your virtual environment.
