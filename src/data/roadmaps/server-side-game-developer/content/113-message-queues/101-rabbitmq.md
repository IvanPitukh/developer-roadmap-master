# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It's designed to offer a common platform for passing messages between different parts of a system or between separate systems. RabbitMQ allows these parts to speak and understand each other even if theyâ€™re written in different programming languages or implemented on different platforms. RabbitMQ is not just limited to AMQP protocol but supports a variety of different messaging protocols including MQTT, STOMP, and more. Also, RabbitMQ is language agnostic, meaning it can be used with almost any programming language. In addition, it comes with a web user interface for managing and monitoring your RabbitMQ server. It's widely used in production systems around the world and can support large scale distributed systems as it supports clustering and fail-over.
