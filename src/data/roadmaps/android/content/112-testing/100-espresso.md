# Espresso

Espresso is a testing framework provided by Android to create UI tests for Android applications. It automatically synchronizes your test actions with the UI of your application, ensuring that your test will only proceed when the necessary UI activities have been completed. In Espresso, you can programmatically simulate user interactions like clicking buttons, typing text, or swiping screens, and then examine the UI's state to confirm it's as expected. Espresso tests can run on devices running Android 4.3 (API level 18) or higher. It's important to note that Espresso tests are written based on what the user can see on the screen.
