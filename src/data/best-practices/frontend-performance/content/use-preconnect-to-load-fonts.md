# Preconnect on Fonts

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
```

When you arrived on a website, your device needs to find out where your site lives and which server it needs to connect with. Your browser had to contact a DNS server and wait for the lookup complete before fetching the resource (fonts, CSS files...). Prefetches and preconnects allow the browser to lookup the DNS information and start establishing a TCP connection to the server hosting the font file. This provides a performance boost because by the time the browser gets around to parsing the css file with the font information and discovering it needs to request a font file from the server, it will already have pre-resolved the DNS information and have an open connection to the server ready in its connection pool.

- Before prefetching your webfonts, use webpagetest to evaluate your website
- Look for teal colored DNS lookups and note the host that are being requested
- Prefetch your webfonts in your `<head>` and add eventually these hostnames that you should prefetch too
