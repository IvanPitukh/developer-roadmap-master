# Tone Reproduction

`Tone Reproduction` or `Tone Mapping` is the technique used in computer graphics to simulate the appearance of high-dynamic-range images in media with a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT, LCD monitors, and other displays can only reproduce a reduced dynamic range. This technique is widely used in gaming development, where developers employ it to improve the visual experience. The process involves taking light from a scene and mapping it to a smaller range of tones while preserving the visual appearanceâ€”i.e., regarding brightness, saturation, and hue. There are various tone mapping algorithms available, each with unique attributes suitable for different imaging tasks.
