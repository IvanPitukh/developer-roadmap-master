# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, specifically designed to process complex input/output transformations. It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence the term 'deep' learning) to model complex, non-linear hypotheses and discover hidden patterns within large datasets. Deep learning techniques are crucial in game development, primarily in creating intelligent behaviors and features in gaming agents, procedural content generation, and player profiling. You might have heard about the uses of deep learning technologies in popular, cutting-edge games like Google DeepMind's AlphaGo. Coding languages like Python, R, and frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch are commonly used for deep learning tasks. Learning Deep Learning can be a prominent game-changer in your game development journey.
