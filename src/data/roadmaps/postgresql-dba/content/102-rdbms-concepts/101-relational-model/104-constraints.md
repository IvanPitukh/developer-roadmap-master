# Constraints in PostgreSQL

Constraints are an essential part of the relational model, as they define rules that the data within the database must follow. They ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and reliable. In this section, we'll explore various types of constraints in PostgreSQL and how to implement them.

## Primary Key

A primary key constraint is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. There can only be one primary key per table, and its value must be unique and non-null for each row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

## Foreign Key

A foreign key constraint ensures that a column or columns in a table refer to an existing row in another table. It helps maintain referential integrity between tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER,
  product_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
);
```

## Unique

A unique constraint ensures that the values in a column or set of columns are unique across all rows in a table. In other words, it prevents duplicate entries in the specified column(s).

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

## Check

A check constraint verifies that the values entered into a column meet a specific condition. It helps to maintain data integrity by restricting the values that can be inserted into a column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC CHECK (price >= 0)
);
```

## Not Null

A NOT NULL constraint enforces that a column cannot contain a NULL value. This ensures that a value must be provided for the specified column when inserting or updating data in the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

## Exclusion

An exclusion constraint is a more advanced form of constraint that allows you to specify conditions that should not exist when comparing multiple rows in a table. It helps maintain data integrity by preventing conflicts in data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservation (
  user_id INTEGER,
  reserved_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  reserved_to TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  EXCLUDE USING gist (user_id WITH =, tsrange(reserved_from, reserved_to) WITH &&)
);
```

In conclusion, constraints are a vital aspect of managing data within PostgreSQL. By using the various constraint types, you can ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and maintains its integrity over time.
