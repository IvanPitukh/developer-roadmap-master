# Memory Management

The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.

To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. There are several memory management methods, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.
