# ESModules

ESModules is a standard that was introduced with ES6 (2015). The idea was to standardize how JS modules work and implement these features in browsers. This standard is widely used with frontend frameworks such as react and can also be used in the backend with Node.js. Sometimes these modules will be written with a .mjs extension.
