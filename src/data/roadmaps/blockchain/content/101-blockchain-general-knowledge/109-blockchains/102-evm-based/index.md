# EVM based

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dedicated software virtual stack that executes smart contract bytecode and is integrated into each Ethereum node. Simply said, EVM is a software framework that allows developers to construct Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps). All Ethereum accounts and smart contracts are stored on this virtual computer.

Many blockchains have forked the Ethereum blockchain and added functionality on top, these blockchains are referred to as EVM-based blockchains.
