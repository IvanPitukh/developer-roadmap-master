# Datagram Construction

Datagram construction is a fundamental process in server-side game development, especially when dealing with UDP (User Datagram Protocol). In this context, a datagram is a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network, which typically encompasses a header and payload data. The process of datagram construction involves encapsulating the specific game data (such as player position, game state, etc.) in the datagram payload and setting appropriate values in the datagram header such as Source and Destination IP addresses, Checksum and other protocol-specific values. Constructing and parsing datagrams correctly is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communication between the game server and clients.
