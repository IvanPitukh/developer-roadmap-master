# Monitoring and Optimizing Resource Usage

Monitoring and optimizing resource usage in Kubernetes (k8s) is crucial for ensuring efficient and effective use of resources. To monitor resource usage, k8s provides a Metrics Server, and Prometheus can be integrated with k8s. The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) can also be used to monitor container-level resource usage data. To optimize resource usage, setting appropriate requests and limits, using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), implementing pod affinity and anti-affinity rules, and controlling node selection can all help reduce resource contention and improve resource utilization. By monitoring and optimizing resource usage, k8s can ensure that applications run efficiently and resources are used effectively.
