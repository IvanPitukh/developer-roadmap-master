# Type Inference

In TypeScript, several places where `type inference` is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. The type of the x variable is inferred to be a number. This inference occurs when variables and members are initialized, set parameter default values are, and determine function return types. For example, `let x: number`. In most cases, type inference is straightforward. In the following sections, weâ€™ll explore some nuances in how types are inferred. For example, `let x: (number | null)[]`
