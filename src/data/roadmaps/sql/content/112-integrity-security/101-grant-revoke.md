# GRANT and REVOKE

In SQL, `GRANT` and `REVOKE` are Data Control Language (DCL) commands used for providing and removing user privileges respectively.

## GRANT

The `GRANT` statement allows database administrators to grant permissions or privileges on a database object to users. There are various types of privileges like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES, ALL.

You can use the `GRANT` statement as follows:

```sql
GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO {user_name |PUBLIC |role_name}
[WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

Example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
```

In this example, `user1` is granted permission to read/perform SELECT operations on the `employees` table.

## REVOKE

The `REVOKE` statement can be used when we want to revoke some or all of the privileges that were assigned earlier to a user or a group of users. The syntax for using the `REVOKE` command is similar to the `GRANT` command.

Here's the syntax:

```sql
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM {user_name |PUBLIC |role_name}
```

Example:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;
```

In this example, `user1` is revoked from the permission to read/perform SELECT operations on the `employees` table.

Permission management is an important aspect of database management, understanding, and using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` operations help in maintaining the integrity and security of your data in SQL.
