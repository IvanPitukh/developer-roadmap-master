# JSON

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans, also easy to parse and generate for machines. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, and Python. In JSON, data is organized in name-value pairs and array data types. It is commonly used for transmitting data in server to web applications and vice versa.
