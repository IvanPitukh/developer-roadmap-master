# Address Conversion

In socket programming, address conversion functions are important for handling internet addresses. Functions like `inet_pton()` (presentation to network) and `inet_ntop()` (network to presentation) are frequently used. `inet_pton()` function converts an IP address in human-friendly format (IPv4 addresses in dotted-decimal notation or IPv6 addresses in hexadecimal notation) to its equivalent binary form. Conversely, `inet_ntop()` function does the reverse, i.e., it converts an IP address in binary form to human-friendly format. These functions are important tools when dealing with IP addresses in lower-level network programming.
