# Frontend automation

Front-end automation is a way to characterize automation that streamlines tasks focused on interactivity, websites, and attended processes. Robotic process automation, or RPA, is considered automation on the front end, or from the user-interface (UI) level. Benefits of front-end automation include quick task building with no programming knowledge, no required changes to existing programs or applications, and those individuals who know the keystrokes can easily build the automation task.
