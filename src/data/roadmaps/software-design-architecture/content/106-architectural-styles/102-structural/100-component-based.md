# Component Based

In software architecture, component-based design (CBD) is an approach to designing software systems by composing them from a set of reusable and independent software components. These components encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily integrated into different parts of the system, allowing for a more modular and flexible design.

In CBD, a software system is divided into a set of components, each of which has a well-defined interface and a specific responsibility. These components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, making it easier to add new features, modify existing ones, and maintain the system.
