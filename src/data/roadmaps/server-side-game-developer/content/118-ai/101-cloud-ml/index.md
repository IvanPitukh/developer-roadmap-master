# Cloud ML

`Cloud Machine Learning` or `Cloud ML` is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that utilizes cloud computing services to provide machine learning capabilities. It enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models in a cloud-based environment. Cloud ML platforms usually offer a range of pre-trained models and services for tasks like image recognition, natural language understanding, and predictive analytics. These platforms support popular ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which can be used to design custom models. Importantly, Cloud ML abstracts the complex infrastructure management associated with large-scale ML computations providing users with more agile, scalable, and accessible machine learning solutions.
