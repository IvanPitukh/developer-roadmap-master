# Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that allows for handling changing data streams and updating the UI based on those changes. In Flutter, reactive programming can be achieved using:

1. Streams: A sequence of asynchronous events.
2. Futures: A way to represent a single asynchronous operation.
3. BLoCs (Business Logic Components): A state management pattern that uses streams to separate business logic from UI code.

Reactive programming in Flutter helps create dynamic and responsive apps that can handle changing data and update the UI accordingly. The `StreamBuilder` and `FutureBuilder` widgets are commonly used in Flutter to build reactive UIs.
