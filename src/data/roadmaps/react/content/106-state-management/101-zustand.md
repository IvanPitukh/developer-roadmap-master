# Zustand

Zustand is a small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy api based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.

Zustand is often used as an alternative to other state management libraries, such as Redux and MobX, because of its simplicity and small size. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized applications, where the complexity of larger state management libraries is not required.
