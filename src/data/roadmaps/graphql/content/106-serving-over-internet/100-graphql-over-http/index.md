# GraphQL over HTTP

GraphQL over HTTP refers to the ability to send GraphQL queries and mutations over the HTTP protocol. This allows clients to interact with a GraphQL server using the same standard HTTP methods and headers that are used for other types of web requests.

The most common way to send GraphQL queries and mutations over HTTP is by using the **POST** method, where the query or mutation is sent in the request body as a JSON payload. The server will then execute the query or mutation and return the result in the response body.
