# C#

C Sharp, usually written as C#, is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s. C# was designed to be a part of the .NET ecosystem and has its syntax foundations based on C and C++. Over time, C# has evolved to include several modern programming features like generics, asynchronous methods, and support for LINQ queries. Thanks to the .NET Core's cross-platform support, C# can now be used to write applications that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. While it's widely used to create Windows desktop applications and games, it's also popular for developing web applications, server-side components, and even mobile applications via Xamarin.
