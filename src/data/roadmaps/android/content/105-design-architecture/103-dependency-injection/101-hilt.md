# Hilt

Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate code that you would normally need to write when setting up manual dependency injection in your project. It is based on the Dagger library, but it simplifies the implementation process and streamlines the use of Dagger in Android apps. To set it up, you must annotate your Android classes and Hilt will automatically generate and provide the necessary dependencies for you. Moreover, Hilt provides predefined set of components tied to the Android lifecycle which helps to handle scoped instances.
