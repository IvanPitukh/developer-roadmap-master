# FRP

`Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)` is an approach to programming that combines functional and reactive concepts, mainly used in front-end and server-side development especially in games. FRP helps to deal with dependent changes, effectively handling 'time-varying values'. It is the elegant solution to describe systems where the current state depends on the future or the past state in a clear and efficient way. Its major concepts include streams (sequences of events over time), observers (consumers of values from a stream), and observables (producers of values), which are the heart of the FRP system. Through these characteristics, it manages data flows and propagation of change making software logic more readable and easier to understand.
