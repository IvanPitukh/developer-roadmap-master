# What Are Relational Databases?

A **relational database** is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a structured way. It uses a structure
that allows data to be identified and accessed in relation to other data in the database. Data in a relational database
is stored in various data tables, each of which has a unique key identifying every row.



Relational databases are made up of a set of tables with data that fits into a predefined category. Each table has at
least one data category in a column, and each row contains a certain data instance for the categories defined in the
columns.

For example, consider an 'Employees' table:

| EmployeeId | FirstName | LastName | Email                 |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| 1          | John      | Doe      | john.doe@example.com  |
| 2          | Jane      | Doe      | jane.doe@example.com  |
| 3          | Bob       | Smith    | bob.smith@example.com |

In this table, 'EmployeeId', 'FirstName', 'LastName' and 'Email' are categories, and each row represents a specific
employee.

## Relationships

The term "relational database" comes from the concept of a relationâ€”a set of tuples that the database organizes into
rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values.

Relational databases use `keys` to create links between tables. A `primary key` is a unique identifier for a row of
data. A `foreign key` is a column or combination of columns used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two
tables.

Consider an additional 'Orders' table:

| OrderId | EmployeeId | Product  |
|---------|------------|----------|
| 1       | 3          | Apples   |
| 2       | 1          | Bananas  |
| 3       | 2          | Cherries |

In the 'Orders' table, 'EmployeeId' serves as the foreign key creating a relationship between 'Orders' and 'Employees'.
This allows queries that involve data in both tables, like "Find all orders placed by John Doe".

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderId, Orders.Product, Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeId = Employees.EmployeeId;
```

The above SQL code is an example of how to retrieve data from a relational database using a `JOIN` clause to combine
rows from two or more tables.

Overall, relational databases provide a powerful mechanism for defining relationships within data and enabling efficient
data retrieval.
