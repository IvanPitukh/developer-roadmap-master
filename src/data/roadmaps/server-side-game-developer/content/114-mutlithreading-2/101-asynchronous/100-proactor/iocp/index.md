# IOCP

The **IOCP**, which stands for **Input/Output Completion Ports**, is a mechanism provided by Microsoft Windows to handle asynchronous I/O operations. It effectively handles the incoming and outgoing operations from the server side utilizing a specific number of threads. Its operation works in a way that whenever an I/O request is initiated, the system will create a packet of information related to the I/O operation, then when the operation completes, it pushes the packet to an IOCP. A pool of threads waits for these operations to complete. As soon as an operation completes, one of the threads from the pool picks up the complete I/O operation from the IOCP and starts processing it. It acts as a multiplexer that routes completed I/O operations to the thread pool, which is an efficient way to handle server-side game development tasks.
