# AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in server side game development refers to the use of algorithms and computational procedures to create systems capable of performing tasks that would require human intelligence. Such tasks include learning and adapting to change, recognizing speech, or even making decisions. In game development, AI is often used to give non-player characters (NPCs) their own 'intelligence', making them even more life-like. This could be as simple as the ability to follow a player around in an environment, or as complex as crafting strategies for combat. AI can also be used to generate procedurally or dynamically generated content, creating potentially infinite unique experiences for the player. AI in games is often programmed in a way where it must strike a balance between appearing intelligent and providing an enjoyable experience for the player.
