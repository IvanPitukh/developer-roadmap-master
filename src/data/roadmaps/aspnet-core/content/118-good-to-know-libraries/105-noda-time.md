# Noda Time

Noda Time is an open-source library for .NET that provides a more complete and accurate way of working with dates, times, and time zones. It addresses the limitations and inconsistencies of the built-in .NET DateTime and TimeZone classes, and provides a number of features that are not present in the .NET framework. It provides a set of immutable and thread-safe value types, such as LocalDate, LocalTime, and Instant. It also provides a time zone abstraction, the DateTimeZone class, that allows you to work with time zones in a more accurate and consistent way, and a set of helper classes and extension methods that make it easy to perform common date and time-related operations.
