# GenFu

GenFu is an open-source library for .NET that provides a simple and flexible way to generate test data for use in automated testing and development. It uses a fluent API to define the types of data that should be generated, and provides a set of built-in generators for common types, such as strings, numbers, and dates. It allows you to easily generate large quantities of test data quickly, and it is especially useful when working with complex object graphs and scenarios that require large amounts of data. It also has built-in support for some of the common libraries like AutoFixture, NBuilder and more, so that you can use it seamlessly with those libraries.
