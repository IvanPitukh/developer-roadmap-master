# Data Normalization: Normal Forms

Data normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables in a relational database in such a way that it reduces data redundancy, improves data integrity, and simplifies the queries to extract and manipulate data. The objective is to separate the data into smaller, related tables, which can be easily managed and updated without causing unnecessary data duplication. The normal forms are the guidelines to achieve this effectively.

There are several normal forms, each with a specific set of rules that must be followed. Let's briefly explain each of them:

## First Normal Form (1NF)

A table is said to be in the First Normal Form (1NF) when:
* It has a primary key, which uniquely identifies each row in the table.
* All columns contain atomic values (i.e., indivisible).
* All entries in a column are of the same data type.
* There are no duplicate rows.

To achieve 1NF, break down columns containing sets or lists into separate rows and remove duplicate data.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

A table is in the Second Normal Form (2NF) when:
* It is already in 1NF.
* All non-primary key columns are fully functionally dependent on the primary key, meaning each non-primary key column's value should depend solely on the primary key's value, and not on any other column.

To achieve 2NF, remove partial dependencies by separating the columns into different tables and establish relationships using foreign keys.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in the Third Normal Form (3NF) when:
* It is already in 2NF.
* There are no transitive dependencies, meaning a non-primary key column should not depend on another non-primary key column, which, in turn, depends on the primary key.

To achieve 3NF, remove transitive dependencies by creating new tables for such columns and establishing relationships using foreign keys.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A table is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) when:
* It is already in 3NF.
* For every functional dependency, the determinant is either a candidate key (i.e., a superkey) or there are no functional dependencies, other than trivial ones.

To achieve BCNF, further decompose tables, and move any violating dependencies into new tables with appropriate keys.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

A table is in the Fourth Normal Form (4NF) when:
* It is already in BCNF.
* There are no multi-valued dependencies, meaning a non-primary key column should not be dependent on another non-primary key column while both being dependent on the primary key.

To achieve 4NF, decompose the table into smaller related tables and use a foreign key relationship to remove multi-valued dependencies.

In most applications, following the rules of 3NF or BCNF is sufficient to ensure the proper organization of data. However, in some specific scenarios, higher normal forms may be necessary to eliminate data redundancy and maintain data integrity.

Remember that normalizing your data simplifies your database design, queries, and maintenance, but it may also lead to performance considerations due to potential increases in the number of joins required for some queries. Evaluate the needs of your specific application to strike a balance between normalization and performance.
