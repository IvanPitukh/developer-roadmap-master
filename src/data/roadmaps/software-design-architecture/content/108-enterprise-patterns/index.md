# Enterprise Patterns

Enterprise patterns are a set of design patterns that are commonly used in the development of enterprise software applications. These patterns provide a common vocabulary and a set of best practices for solving common problems that arise in the development of large, complex software systems. Some examples of enterprise patterns include:

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event Sourcing
- Microservices
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

These patterns can help to improve the maintainability and scalability of the software, by providing a clear separation of concerns and allowing for a more modular and flexible architecture.
