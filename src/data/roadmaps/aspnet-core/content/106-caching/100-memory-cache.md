# Memory Cache

Memory caching (often simply referred to as caching) is a technique in which computer applications temporarily store data in a computerâ€™s main memory (i.e., random access memory, or RAM) to enable fast retrievals of that data. The RAM that is used for the temporary storage is known as the cache.
