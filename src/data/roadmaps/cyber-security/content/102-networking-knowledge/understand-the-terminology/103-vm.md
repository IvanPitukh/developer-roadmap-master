# VM

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a computer system that operates on a physical hardware, also known as a host. VMs provide an additional layer of isolation and security as they run independent of the host's operating system. They can execute their own operating system (called the guest OS) and applications, allowing users to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware simultaneously.

Virtual machines are commonly used in cybersecurity for tasks such as:

- **Testing and analysis**: Security researchers often use VMs to study malware and vulnerabilities in a safe and contained environment without risking their primary system.

- **Network segmentation**: VMs can be used to isolate different network segments within an organization, to help prevent the spread of malware or limit the impact of an attack.

- **System recovery**: VMs can act as backups for critical systems or applications. In the event of a system failure, a VM can be spun up to provide continuity in business operations.

- **Software development and testing**: Developers can use VMs to build and test software in a controlled and reproducible environment, reducing the risks of incompatibilities or unexpected behaviors when the software is deployed on a live system.

Key terminologies associated with VMs include:

- **Hypervisor**: Also known as Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a software or hardware component that creates, runs, and manages virtual machines. Hypervisors are divided into two types - Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted).

- **Snapshot**: A snapshot is a point-in-time image of a virtual machine that includes the state of the guest OS, applications, and data. Snapshots are useful for quickly reverting a VM back to a previous state if needed.

- **Live Migration**: This refers to the process of moving a running virtual machine from one physical host to another with minimal or no disruption to the guest OS and its applications. Live migration enables load balancing and ensures minimal downtime during hardware maintenance.

Understanding and effectively utilizing virtual machines plays a significant role in enhancing the security posture of an organization, allowing for agile incident response and proactive threat analysis.
