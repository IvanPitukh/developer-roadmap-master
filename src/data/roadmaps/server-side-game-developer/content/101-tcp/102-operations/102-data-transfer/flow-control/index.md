# Flow Control

Flow control, often referred to as stream control transmission protocol (SCTP), is essential in server-side game development, particularly in data transfer. Flow control is basically a technique used to manage the rate of data transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. It provides an effective way to manage the amount of data that can be sent before having to receive an acknowledgment. There are two main types of flow control: window-based and rate-based. Window-based flow control allows the receiver to process a fixed set of packets before sending the acknowledgement, whereas rate-based control allows for data transfer at a specified rate. These methods make flow control indispensable in network communications.
