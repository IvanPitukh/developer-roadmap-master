# Metrics

Metrics to monitor include CPU usage, memory usage, network usage, disk usage, API server metrics, pod and container metrics, and cluster-level metrics. These metrics provide insights into the performance and health of the cluster, nodes, and applications running on the cluster. Kubernetes provides tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes Dashboard for collecting and analyzing these metrics. By monitoring these metrics, administrators can identify performance issues and optimize the cluster for better performance and scalability.
