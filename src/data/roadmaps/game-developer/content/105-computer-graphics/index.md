# Computer Graphics

Computer Graphics is a subfield of computer science that studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. It involves creating and manipulating visual content using specialized computer software and hardware. This field is primarily used in the creation of digital and video games, CGI in films, and also in visual effects for commercials. The field is divided into two major categories: **Raster graphics** and **Vector graphics**. Raster graphics, also known as bitmap, involve the representation of images through a dot matrix data structure, while Vector graphics involve the use of polygons to represent images in computer graphics. Both of these methods have their unique usage scenarios. Other concepts integral to the study of computer graphics include rendering (including both real-time rendering and offline rendering), animation, and 3D modeling. Generally, computer graphics skills are essential for game developers and animation experts.
