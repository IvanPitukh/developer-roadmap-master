# Choosing a Managed Provider

A managed provider is a cloud-based service that provides a managed Kubernetes environment. This means that the provider handles the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking, as well as the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the Kubernetes cluster.

When choosing a managed Kubernetes provider, consider the cloud provider you are using, features and capabilities, pricing and billing, support, security and compliance, and the provider's reputation and reviews. By taking these factors into account, you can select a provider that meets your needs and offers the best value for your organization.
