# Testing Approaches

Test approach has two techniques:
Proactive - An approach in which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to find and fix the defects before the build is created.
Reactive - An approach in which the testing is not started until after design and coding are completed.

Three approaches are commonly used to implement functional testing:

- Black Box Testing
- White Box Testing
- Gray Box Testing
