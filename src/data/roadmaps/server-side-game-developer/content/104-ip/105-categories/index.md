**Class B** IP addresses are allocated to medium-sized and large-sized networks and ranges from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255. 

**Class C** IP addresses are utilized for small-sized networks and ranges from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255. 

**Class D** IP address is designed for multicast groups and ranges from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. 

Lastly, **Class E** IP address ranges from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 and is preserved for research and development purposes.
