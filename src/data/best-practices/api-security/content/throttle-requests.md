# Throttle Requests

> Limit requests (throttling) to avoid DDoS / Brute Force attacks.

Limiting requests through throttling is important to prevent DDoS attacks and brute force attacks. DDoS attacks overwhelm the server with too many requests, while brute force attacks try to guess user credentials through multiple login attempts.

Throttling limits the number of requests that can be sent within a certain time period, making it harder for attackers to carry out these types of attacks. This can protect the system from being overwhelmed and can prevent attackers from gaining unauthorized access.
