# Error Detection

Error detection is a mechanism that checks the integrity of data that is being delivered or stored. In the context of server-side game development, errors can occur due to reasons like network inconsistencies, corrupted data, or server overload. To ensure smooth operation, these errors need to be detected and handled. Some common types of error detection methods include parity check, checksum, and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Parity check adds an extra bit to the data to make the number of 1â€™s either even or odd. Checksum involves the sender adding up all the bits in the data and sending the sum along with data. CRC is a more complex and robust method involving binary division. These methods help detect errors but can't fix them. Once detected, errors are typically dealt with through retransmission or by using forward error correction codes.
