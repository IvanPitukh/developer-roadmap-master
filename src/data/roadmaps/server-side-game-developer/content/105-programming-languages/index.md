# Programming Languages

Programming languages are an essential part of game development. They create the logic and rules for how your game operates. There are various types of programming languages that a server side game developer can use, such as C++, Python, Ruby, etc. These languages have different syntax and structures, as well as varying degrees of complexity. The complexity and capabilities can affect the game's performance, security, and even its potential compatibility with other platforms. Your choice of language often depends greatly on the specific needs of the project and your personal expertise. Picking up a new language can be time-consuming, so it's important to choose wisely. Markdown is another language that's popular for documentation due to its simplicity and readability, but it isn't typically used to code server-side game elements.
