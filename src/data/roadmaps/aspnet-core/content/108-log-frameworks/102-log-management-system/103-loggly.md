# Loggly

Loggly is a cloud-based log management and analytics platform that helps organizations to collect, store, and analyze log data from a variety of sources, including .NET and ASP.NET applications. It provides a wide range of features such as real-time log search and analysis, alerting, and reporting, and allows for easy integration with other tools such as Datadog, Splunk, and New Relic.

In an ASP.NET application, Loggly can be used to collect and analyze log data. Loggly provides an SDK, called Loggly.Serilog, which can be integrated with an ASP.NET application to automatically collect log data and send it to Loggly. The SDK can be configured to collect different types of log data, such as log messages, error messages, and custom events.
