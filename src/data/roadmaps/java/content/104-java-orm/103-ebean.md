# Ebean

Ebean is an object-relational mapping tool written in Java. It supports the standard JPA annotations for declaring entities. However, it provides a much simpler API for persisting. In fact, one of the points worth mentioning about the Ebean architecture is that it is sessionless, meaning it does not fully manage entities.
