  - question: What is JavaScript?
    answer: JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in web development. It enables interactive and dynamic behavior on websites.

  - question: What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?
    answer: In JavaScript, `var` is function-scoped and was traditionally used to declare variables. `let` and `const` are block-scoped. The key difference between `let` and `const` is that `let` allows for reassignment while `const` creates a read-only reference.

      - 'Beginner'
  - question: What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
    answer: The `null` is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. But the `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value, or a variable that has not been assigned a value.

  - question: What is a JavaScript promise?
    answer: A Promise in JavaScript represents a value that may not be available yet but will be at some point. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations, offering methods like `.then()` and `.catch()` to register callbacks for success and failure.

      - 'Advanced'
  - question: What is the purpose of the `async/await` in JavaScript?
    answer: The `async/await`, introduced in ES2017, provides a more readable and cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks and promises. An `async` function always returns a promise, and within such a function, you can use `await` to pause execution until a promise settles.

  - question: What is the difference between `Map` and `WeakMap` in JavaScript?
    answer: The `Map` object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Whereas, the `WeakMap` object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. You can use any data type as a key or value in a `Map` whereas in `WeakMap` you can only use objects as keys. The `WeakMap` is not iterable whereas `Map` is. In `WeakMap` it holds the weak reference to the original object which means if there are no other references to an object stored in the `WeakMap`, those objects can be garbage collected.
    topics:
      - 'Data Type'
      - 'Advanced'
  - question: Garbage collection in JavaScript?
    answer: The JavaScript engine uses automatic garbage collection. JavaScript automatically manages memory by freeing up space used by objects no longer needed. This algorithm is called Mark and Sweep, which is performed periodically by the JavaScript engine.

  - question: What is Type Casting?
    answer: Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another. Implicit conversion happens when the compiler (for compiled languages) or runtime (for script languages like `JavaScript`) automatically converts data types.

    answer: In order to define multiline strings in JavaScript, you need to use template literals.

These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (``` `${expression}` ```).

  - question: What is Event Loop in JavaScript?
    answer: The Event loop is one the most important aspect to understand in JavaScript. It is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. It is the reason why we can use asynchronous code in JavaScript. The Event loop is a loop that constantly checks if there are any tasks that need to be executed. If there are, it will execute them. If there are no tasks to execute, it will wait for new tasks to arrive.

  - question: Is it possible to run JavaScript outside the browser?
    answer: Yes, it is possible to run JavaScript outside the browser. There are several ways to run JavaScript outside the browser. You can use **Node.js**, **Deno**, **Bun**, or any other JavaScript runtime environment.

  - question: Is it possible to run 2 lines of code at the same time in JavaScript?
    answer: No, it is not possible to run 2 lines of code at the same time in JavaScript. JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it can only execute one line of code at a time. However, it is possible to run 2 lines of code at the same time using asynchronous code.

  - question: Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language?
    answer: JavaScript is an interpreted language. This means that the JavaScript code is not compiled before it is executed. Instead, the JavaScript engine interprets the code at runtime.

  - question: Are references copied in JavaScript?
    answer: No, references are not copied in JavaScript. When you assign an object to a variable, the variable will contain a reference to the object. If you assign the variable to another variable, the second variable will also contain a reference to the object. If you change the object using one of the variables, the change will be visible using the other variable.
