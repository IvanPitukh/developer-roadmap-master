# Multi Cluster Management

Multi-Cluster Management in Kubernetes (k8s) refers to the ability to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters using a single control plane. This approach allows administrators to centrally manage and orchestrate resources across multiple clusters, regardless of where they are located, without having to switch between multiple management consoles or tools.
