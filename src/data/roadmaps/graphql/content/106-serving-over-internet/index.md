# Serving Over Internet

Serving GraphQL over the internet refers to the process of making a GraphQL server available to clients over the internet, typically by exposing the server's endpoint through a public IP address or a domain name.

There are several ways to serve a GraphQL server over the internet:

- Using a reverse proxy
- Using a cloud service
- Using a serverless function
