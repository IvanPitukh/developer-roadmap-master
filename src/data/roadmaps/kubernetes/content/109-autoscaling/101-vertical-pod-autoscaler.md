# Vertical Pod Autoscaler

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) is a Kubernetes feature that automates the process of adjusting resource limits for containers in pods. Unlike Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which scales the number of replicas of a pod, VPA scales the resources allocated to a pod's containers. It adjusts the resource requests and limits for each container based on its actual usage.
