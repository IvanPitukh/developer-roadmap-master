# Newman

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster. It is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test, and document APIs. With this open-source solution, users can create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests and read their responses.

Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It's built with extensibility to integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.
