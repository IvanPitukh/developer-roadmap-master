# Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source tool developed by Google that is used to audit the performance, accessibility, and SEO of web pages. It is available as a browser extension and as a command-line tool, and it can be run on any web page to generate a report with recommendations for improvement.

Lighthouse works by simulating the load and interaction of a web page and measuring various performance metrics, such as load time, time to first paint, and time to interactive. It also checks for common issues such as incorrect image sizes, missing alt text, and broken links.

Lighthouse provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for identifying and fixing performance and accessibility issues on web pages. It is widely used by web developers and is integrated into many popular development tools.
