Kubernetes (k8s) is needed because it provides a powerful and flexible platform for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. It allows for easy scalability, high resilience, application portability, automation of many tasks, and standardization of the container platform. k8s also helps reduce complexity and workload for operations teams, enabling them to focus on more strategic initiatives.
