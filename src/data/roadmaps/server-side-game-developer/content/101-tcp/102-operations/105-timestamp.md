# Timestamp

A `timestamp` in server side game development is essentially a sequence of characters, encoding the date and time at which a certain event occurred. This data is particularly significant when tracking the sequence of certain events, debugging issues, logging, and when performing any sort of data analysis. The timestamp is typically generated by the server and it reflects the server's current date and time. For instance, you might find it in a server log file, indicating when each event occurred, or in a database row, showing when each row was created or last updated. Timestamps are often included in the HTTP headers to let the client know when the resource was last modified.
