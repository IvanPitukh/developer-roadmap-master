# Python

Python is a popular high-level programming language that was designed by Guido van Rossum and published in 1991.  It is preferred for its simplicity in learning and usage, making it a great choice for beginners. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help developers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. Moreover, it supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often used for web development, software development, database operations, and machine learning. Although not typically used for game development, some game developers utilize Python for scripting and automating tasks.
