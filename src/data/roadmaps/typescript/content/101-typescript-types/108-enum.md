# Enum

Enums is not a type-level extension of JavaScript. It allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

Here is an example of a numeric enum in TypeScript:

```typescript
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```

Above, we have a numeric enum where `Up` is initialized with `1`. All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on. In other words, `Direction.Up` has the value `1`, `Down` has `2`, `Left` has `3`, and `Right` has `4`.

If we left off the initializer for `Up`, it would have the value `0` and the rest of the members would be auto-incremented from there.
