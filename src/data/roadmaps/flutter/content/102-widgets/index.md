# Widgets

Widgets in Flutter are the basic building blocks of the user interface. They define how the UI looks and behaves. Widgets can be combined to create complex user interfaces and can be easily customized. Some common types of widgets include:

- Text
- Image
- Button
- Container
- Card
- Column & Row
- ListView
- AppBar
- Scaffold

Widgets in Flutter are also designed to be highly reusable, allowing developers to build complex UIs quickly and efficiently.
