# Behavioral Economics

Behavioral Economics is a subfield of economics that studies the psychological, social, and emotional factors that influence decision-making and economic behavior. It seeks to understand why people make choices that deviate from the traditional economic model, which assumes that individuals behave rationally and seek to maximize their utility.

The key concepts of Behavioral Economics include:

- Bounded Rationality: People make decisions based on limited information, cognitive constraints, and personal biases.

- Prospect Theory: Individuals perceive losses and gains asymmetrically, feeling greater pain from a loss than satisfaction from an equivalent gain.

- Anchoring: People tend to rely on a reference point (the anchor) when assessing the value of an unknown option, which can lead to arbitrary or irrational decisions.

- Mental Accounting: Individuals mentally categorize and allocate expenses differently, which can lead to biases like the sunk cost fallacy or the endowment effect.

- Nudging: Subtle changes to choice architecture can influence people's decisions without restricting their freedom of choice, through methods like default options, framing, or social proof.

Understanding and applying behavioral economic principles can help UX designers create interfaces and experiences that account for these biases and help users make better choices. By designing to minimize cognitive load, supporting decision-making, and presenting options effectively, UX designers can enhance user satisfaction and encourage desired actions.
