# Programming Techniques

Programming techniques are methods that are used to write series of instructions (code) that a computer can interpret and execute. There are many ways one can write code, unique to both the individual and the programming language they are using. Techniques such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) involve the use of encapsulated objects and inheritance. Functional Programming focuses on mathematical functions, avoiding changes in state and mutable data. Procedural Programming focuses on the process of executing predefined steps of functions to achieve the end result, while Event-Driven programming primarily acts upon user interactions, like mouse clicks or key presses. You can choose one technique depending on the game development requirements, the development team's competence, and preference.
