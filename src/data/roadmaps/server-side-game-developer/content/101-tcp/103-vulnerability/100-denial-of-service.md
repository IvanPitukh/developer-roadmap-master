# Denial of Service

Denial of Service (DoS) is a malicious attempt to disrupt the regular functioning of a network, service, or server by overwhelming the network or server with a flood of internet traffic. The most common type of DoS attack involves flooding the target with unnecessary requests in an attempt to overload the system. In a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, multiple computers are used to carry out the cyber attack. For servers, these attacks can significantly affect the availability and performance of games, causing a poor experience for the users.
