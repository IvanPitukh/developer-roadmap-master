# Credentials API

The Credential Management API is a web API that allows web developers to integrate password-based and federated login flows into their applications. It provides a standardized, browser-based interface for storing and retrieving user credentials, such as username and password combinations and OAuth tokens.

To use the Credential Management API, a web page must first create a Credential object and specify the credentials that the user wishes to store. The page can then use the navigator.credentials object to store and retrieve the user's credentials. The API provides several methods for storing and retrieving credentials, as well as for prompting the user to sign in or sign up.

The Credential Management API is supported by most modern web browsers and is designed to improve the security and usability of login flows by allowing the user to store and reuse their credentials across multiple sites and devices.
