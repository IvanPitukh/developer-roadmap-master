# Erlang

Erlang is a functional, general-purpose concurrent programming language that supports distributed computation. It originated in the late 1980s, born from Ericson Inc., with the aim to improve the development of telephony applications. Erlang has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance which make it a popular choice for developing large scale, real-time systems. The language is mostly used in sectors where systems must continue to work despite errors, such as banking, eCommerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Over the years, Erlang has been employed in blockchain development, internet of things (IoT) and online gaming programming where robust server-side development is required.
