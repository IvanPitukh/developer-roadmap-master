# Architecture and Design Patterns

In Android, **Design Architecture** refers to structuring the code in a way that increases its readability, maintainability, and testability. There are several ways to design architecture like [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), [Model-View-Presenter (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter), [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel), and [Model-View-Intent (MVI)](https://www.raywenderlich.com/817602-mvi-architecture-for-android-tutorial-getting-started). Each of these define the interaction between the data, the logic, and the UI layers. Googleâ€™s recommended architectural pattern is [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) which follow the principles of the MVVM pattern. Bear in mind that an architecture is not a rigid structure that fits all solutions. Rather, it serves as a guideline and can be tweaked as necessary.
