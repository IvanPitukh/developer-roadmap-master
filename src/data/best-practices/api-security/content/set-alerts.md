> Use alerts for SMS, Slack, Email, Kibana, Cloudwatch, etc.

Using alerts for various communication channels such as SMS, Slack, Email, Kibana, Cloudwatch, etc. can help you quickly respond to any issues or anomalies in your system. These alerts can be set up to notify you in real-time if a particular event or condition occurs, allowing you to take proactive measures to prevent downtime, data loss, or security breaches. Additionally, alerts can provide valuable insights into system performance and user behavior, allowing you to make informed decisions about your API's design and implementation.
