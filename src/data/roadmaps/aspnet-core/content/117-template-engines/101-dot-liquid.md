# DotLiquid

DotLiquid is an open-source templating engine for .NET that is based on the Liquid template language. It allows you to embed dynamic data in HTML templates, and is commonly used for generating email templates, reports, and other types of documents. It is a .NET implementation of the Liquid template language, it provides a simple and easy-to-use API for parsing and rendering Liquid templates, and can be easily integrated with ASP.NET and other .NET frameworks. It is often used in web applications to separate the logic of the application from the presentation of the data, making it easy to change the appearance of the application without having to change the underlying code.
