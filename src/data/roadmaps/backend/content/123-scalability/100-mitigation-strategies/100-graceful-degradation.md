# Graceful Degradation

Graceful degradation is a design principle that states that a system should be designed to continue functioning, even if some of its components or features are not available. In the context of web development, graceful degradation refers to the ability of a web page or application to continue functioning, even if the user's browser or device does not support certain features or technologies.

Graceful degradation is often used as an alternative to progressive enhancement, a design principle that states that a system should be designed to take advantage of advanced features and technologies if they are available.
