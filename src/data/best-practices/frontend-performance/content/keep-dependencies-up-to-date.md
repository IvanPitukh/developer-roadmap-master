# Dependency Updates

> All JavaScript libraries used in your project are necessary (prefer Vanilla JavaScript for simple functionalities), updated to their latest version and don't overwhelm your JavaScript with unnecessary methods.

Most of the time, new versions come with optimization and security fix. You should use the most optimized code to speed up your project and ensure that you'll not slow down your website or app without outdated plugin.

If your project use NPM packages, [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) is a pretty interesting library to upgrade / update your libraries. [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) can automatically look for your dependencies and suggest an update every time a new version is out.
