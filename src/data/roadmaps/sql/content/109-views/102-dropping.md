# Dropping Views

"Dropping" in SQL is the process of deleting an existing database object. In the context of views, "dropping" refers to deleting an existing view from the database. Once a view is dropped, it cannot be used any longer until it is recreated with the same or new definition. If you're going to drop a view, ensure it's not being used anywhere in your application or it will lead to errors.

## Dropping Views

You can drop a view in SQL using the `DROP VIEW` statement. The `DROP VIEW` statement removes one or more views from the database. You specify the name of the view that you want to remove after the `DROP VIEW` clause. 

Here is the basic syntax to drop an existing view:

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

To drop multiple views in a single command, you use a list of comma-separated views.

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name1, view_name2, ..., view_name_n;
```

**Note**: Be careful when dropping views. Once a view is dropped, all the permissions granted on it will also be dropped. 

Before dropping a view, you can check if the view exists by using the `IF EXISTS` parameter. If you drop a view that does not exist, you will get an error. To prevent this, you can use the `IF EXISTS` parameter. 

Here is how you do it:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;
```

In this case, if the view exists, it will be dropped. If the view does not exist, nothing happens and you don't get an error.
