# Template Literal Types

Template literal types in TypeScript are a way to manipulate string values as types. They allow you to create a type based on the result of string manipulation or concatenation. Template literal types are created using the backtick (``) character and string manipulation expressions within the type.

For example, the following is a template literal type that concatenates two strings:

```typescript
type Name = `Mr. ${string}`;

let name: Name = `Mr. Smith`;  // ok
let name: Name = `Mrs. Smith`;  // error
```

In this example, the `Name` template literal type is created by concatenating the string `"Mr. "` with the type `string`. This type can then be used to enforce that a value must be a string that starts with `"Mr. "`.
