# ACLs

Access Control Lists (ACLs) act as an essential part of an organization's security infrastructure by helping to manage access rights to resources and maintain security between users, groups, and systems.

In this section, we will discuss the following:

- What are Access Control Lists
- Types of ACLs
- How to implement and administer ACLs

## What are Access Control Lists

Access Control Lists are rule sets that define which user, group, or system has access to specific resources and determine what type of access they have (e.g., read or write). ACLs act as a barrier to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems; this can help maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your organization's critical assets.

## Types of ACLs

There are two primary types of ACLs: Discretionary and Mandatory.

- **Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs)**  
  DACLs allow the owner of a resource to determine who can gain access to the resource, and the level of access they can have. For example, a user or a group of users may have read access rights to a particular file, whereas another group may have full control over the file.

- **Mandatory Access Control Lists (MACLs)**  
  MACLs rely on predefined security labels or classifications to enforce access control. In this case, resources are assigned security labels, and users or systems are given security clearances. Access is granted only if the user's security clearance level matches the resource label.

## Implementing and Administering ACLs

Here are some best practices you can follow when implementing and administering Access Control Lists:

- **Define clear access policies**: Establish clear rules and guidelines for accessing resources, such as who can access specific resources and what type of access they can have.

- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign permissions to roles instead of individual users. This will help simplify the ACL management process.

- **Regular audits and reviews**: Periodically review and update the ACLs to ensure that access permissions are aligned with business requirements and security policies.

- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: Grant users the minimum privileges they need to perform their tasks.

- **Maintain a change management process**: Document all changes to ACLs, including the date of change, the reason for the change, and the individual responsible for executing the change.

Remember that a well-implemented and maintained ACL system can significantly reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to your organization's critical assets.
