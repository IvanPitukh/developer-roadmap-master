# SOAP

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a message protocol for exchanging information between systems and applications. When it comes to application programming interfaces (APIs), a SOAP API is developed in a more structured and formalized way. SOAP messages can be carried over a variety of lower-level protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
