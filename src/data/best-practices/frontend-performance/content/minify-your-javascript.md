# Minify JavaScript

> All JavaScript files are minified, comments, white spaces and new lines are removed from production files (still valid if using HTTP/2).

Removing all unnecessary spaces, comments and break will reduce the size of your JavaScript files and speed up your site's page load times and obviously lighten the download for your user.

Use the tools suggested below to minify your files automatically before or during your build or your deployment.
