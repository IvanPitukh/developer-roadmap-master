# Reviewing Patches

One of the most valuable contributions to PostgreSQL is reviewing and testing patches submitted by other developers. This process ensures that every proposed change undergoes quality control, helps new contributors get involved and learn about PostgreSQL, and maintains the overall stability and reliability of the project.

### Why is reviewing patches important?

- Improves code quality by identifying bugs, security issues, and performance problems
- Helps maintain consistency and adherence to project standards and best practices
- Provides valuable feedback for developers working on new features and enhancements
- Helps new contributors learn about PostgreSQL internals and progressively grow their expertise

### How can I participate in reviewing patches?

- Subscribe to the [pgsql-hackers mailing list](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-hackers/) where patch discussions and reviews take place.
- Browse the [commitfest schedule](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/) to stay informed about upcoming events and deadlines.
- Choose a patch from the commitfest that interests you or that you feel confident to review.
- Analyze the patch to ensure:
   - Correctness: Does the patch work as intended and solve the problem it addresses?
   - Performance: Does the patch avoid introducing performance regressions or trade-offs?
   - Code quality: Is the code clean, modular, and maintainable? Does it adhere to PostgreSQL coding conventions?
   - Documentation: Are the changes properly documented, and do they provide the necessary context for other developers?
   - Test coverage: Are there appropriate tests covering the new code or changes?
- Provide feedback on the patch, either by replying to the relevant mailing list thread or by commenting directly on the patch submission in the commitfest app. Be constructive and specific in your comments, and offer suggestions for improvement when possible.
- Follow up on any discussion around your review and participate in ongoing improvements and iterations of the patch.

Remember, reviewing patches is a collaborative process that relies on the input of many individuals. Your contributions are essential in maintaining the high quality and stability of the PostgreSQL project.
