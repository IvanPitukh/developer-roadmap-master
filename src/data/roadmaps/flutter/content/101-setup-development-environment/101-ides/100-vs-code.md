# VS Code

To use VS Code for Flutter development, you must install the Flutter and Dart plugins for VS Code. These plugins support Flutter-specific features such as syntax highlighting, debugging, and hot reloading.

Here are the steps to set up VS Code for Flutter development:

- Install VS Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Open VS Code and click the Extensions icon on the left-hand side of the window.
- In the search box, type "Flutter" and press Enter. This will display a list of Flutter-related plugins.
- Install the "Flutter" and "Dart" plugins by clicking the Install button next to each one.
- Once the plugins are installed, you will need to restart VS Code for the changes to take effect.
- To create a new Flutter project, click the File menu, then select New > New Project. This will open the New Project dialog box.
- Select the Flutter application template, enter the project's name and location and click Create. This will create a new Flutter project in the specified location.
- To run the project, open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) and type "flutter run". This will run the project on the default emulator or device.

That's it! You should now be able to use VS Code for Flutter development.
